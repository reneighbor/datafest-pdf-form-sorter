professional money managers for the expertise and guidance needed to map out a successful investment strategy. Morgan Stanley, a global leader in financial management, has developed the Charter Series of partnerships to provide professional money management in the futures, options, and forward markets.
An investment in a partnership is speculative and involves a high degree of risk. The general partner and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated believe that managed futures investments (such as the partnerships) can provide you with the potential for long-term capital appreciation (with commensurate risk), but are appropriate only for the aggressive growth portion of an investor's comprehensive financial plan. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 12. Taking the risks into consideration, this investment does offer the following potential advantages.
Investment Diversification
If you are not prepared to make a significant investment or spend substantial time trading various futures, forwards, and options, you may still participate in these markets through an investment in a Charter Series partnership, obtaining diversification from more traditional investments in stocks, bonds, and real estate. The general partner believes, on the basis of past experience, that the profit potential of a partnership does not depend upon favorable general economic conditions, and that a partnership is as likely to be profitable during periods of declining stock, bond, and real estate markets as at any other time; conversely, a partnership may be unprofitable during periods of generally favorable economic conditions.
Managed futures investments can serve to diversify your portfolio and smooth overall portfolio volatility. This concept has been explored in Modern Portfolio Theory, which was originally developed in the 1950s by Nobel Laureates William Sharpe and Harold Markowitz. These two pioneers developed a framework for efficiently diversifying assets within a portfolio. They suggested that investing in any asset class with positive returns and low correlation to other assets improves the overall risk/reward characteristics of the entire portfolio. In 1983, Dr. John H. Lintner of Harvard University focused on the concepts of Modern Portfolio Theory in a study about portfolio diversification. Specifically, Modern Portfolio Theory was utilized to evaluate the addition of a managed futures component to a diversified portfolio comprised of 60% stocks and 40% bonds. The results of Lintner's work demonstrated that by including a variety of assets, such as commodities, in a hypothetical portfolio, an investor may lower the portfolio's overall volatility or risk. Lintner's findings were further supported by the works of Dr. Thomas Schneeweis of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in his 1999 study, "The Benefits of Managed Futures." Dr. Schneeweis concluded that "while . . . the correlation between managed futures and most traditional investments is approximately zero, when asset returns are segmented according to whether the traditional asset rose or fell, managed futures are often negatively correlated in months when traditional asset returns are negative while being positively correlated when traditional asset returns are positive."
The partnerships' combined benefits of growth potential (with commensurate risk) and diversification can potentially reduce the overall volatility of your portfolio, while increasing profits. By combining asset classes, you may create a portfolio mix that provides the potential to offer the greatest possible return within acceptable levels of volatility. Whether you are able to lower the overall volatility of your portfolio with managed futures investments will depend in part on the characteristics of your portfolio. Depending on these characteristics, the addition of a managed futures investment could increase or decrease the overall volatility and risk of your
^	portfolio. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, managed futures investments,
qfi	such as the partnerships, may profit (with commensurate risk) from futures, forward, and options
l$T	market moves, with the potential to enhance your overall portfolio. LflO
The trading advisor's speculative trading techniques will be the primary factor in a
