physical demand and high inventories. Smaller gains of approximately 0.4% were recorded in the global stock index sector from long positions in European and Asian stock index futures in January as global equity prices trended higher after a weaker than expected December U.S. jobs report raised hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve would end its cycle of interest rate hikes sooner rather than later. In December, long positions in European and Asian equity index futures resulted in gains as prices moved higher, lifted by a decline in oil prices and speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve could possibly cut interest rates in the near future. Additionally, European stocks gained on speculation of increased merger and acquisition activity in the region, while Pacific Rim stock markets ended higher as consumer spending continued to pick up in China and Japan. A portion of the partnership's gains for the year was offset by a loss of approximately 0.4% in the currency sector from long U.S. dollar positions versus the euro and Australian dollar as the U.S. dollar's value reversed lower in January on expectations that a string of increases in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve would end. Also pushing the value of the U.S. dollar lower against its rivals was speculation that China, with a massive U.S. dollar reserve, might diversify some of its assets into other currencies. In February, further losses were recorded from short U.S. dollar positions relative to the Australian dollar as the value of the U.S. dollar reversed higher due to predictions that U.S. interest rates would continue to increase. The value of the Australian dollar also moved lower in the wake of a temporary decline in gold prices. Further losses in the currency markets were recorded during May and June from long positions in the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar as the value of the U.S. dollar reversed higher after hawkish comments from several U.S. Federal Reserve officials implied another interest rate hike was necessary to help contain rising inflation. Losses were incurred during early July from short positions in the U.S. dollar against the euro and Swiss franc as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most of its major rivals following narrower than expected May U.S. trade deficit data. Meanwhile, the value of the euro was pressured lower after the European Central Bank decided to keep interest rates unchanged. Further losses were also recorded from short positions in the British pound versus the euro and U.S. dollar as the British pound strengthened amid strong economic growth in the United Kingdom. Finally, during August, losses were incurred from short positions in the U.S. dollar versus the Swiss franc, euro, and Australian dollar as the U.S. dollar reversed higher in late August and early September after revisions to U.S. quarterly productivity data showed that unit labor costs had risen in 2006 at the fastest pace since 1990. Within the energy sector, further losses of approximately 0.4% were recorded primarily during May from long futures positions in crude oil as prices fell on renewed optimism that the standoff between Iran and the West would be resolved diplomatically. During June, smaller losses were incurred from short futures positions in crude oil and its related products as prices reversed higher amid reports from the U.S. Department of Energy showing lower than expected levels of domestic gasoline inventories and fears of supply disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico.
