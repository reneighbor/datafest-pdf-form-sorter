performance of Charter WCM and Charter Aspect is not applicable to the new trading advisors, Winton and Aspect, prior to December 1, 2006.
Market illiquidity may cause less favorable trade prices. Although the trading advisor for each partnership generally will purchase and sell actively traded contracts where last trade price information and quoted prices are readily available, the prices at which a sale or purchase occur may differ from the prices expected because there may be a delay between receiving a quote and executing a trade, particularly in circumstances where a market has limited trading volume and prices are often quoted for relatively limited quantities. In addition, most U.S. futures exchanges have established "daily price fluctuation limits" which preclude the execution of trades at prices outside of the limit, and, from time to time, the CFTC or the exchanges may suspend trading in market disruption circumstances. In these cases it is possible that a partnership could be required to maintain a losing position that it otherwise would execute and incur significant losses or be unable to establish a position and miss a profit opportunity.
Trading on non-U.S. exchanges presents greater risks to each partnership than trading on U.S. exchanges.
•	Each partnership trades on exchanges located outside the U.S. Trading on U.S. exchanges is subject to CFTC regulation and oversight, including, for example, minimum capital requirements for commodity brokers, regulation of trading practices on the exchanges, prohibitions against trading ahead of customer orders, prohibitions against filling orders off exchanges, prescribed risk disclosure statements, testing and licensing of industry sales personnel and other industry professionals, and recordkeeping requirements. Trading on non-U.S. exchanges is not regulated by the CFTC or any other U.S. governmental agency or instrumentality and may be subject to regulations that are different from those to which U.S. exchange trading is subject, provide less protection to investors than trading on U.S. exchanges, and may be less vigorously enforced than regulations in the U.S.
•	Positions on non-U.S. exchanges also are subject to the risk of exchange controls, expropriation, excessive taxation or government disruptions.
•	A partnership could incur losses when determining the value of its non-U.S. positions in U.S. dollars because of fluctuations in exchange rates.
Each partnership must deposit margin with respect to the partnership's futures and options contracts on both U.S. exchanges and on non-U.S. exchanges and must deposit margin with respect to its foreign currency forward contracts to assure the partnership's performance on those contracts. Set forth below for each partnership is the average percentage of month-end estimated margin requirements for the period March 2007 through February 2008, that relate to futures and options contracts on non-U.S. exchanges as compared to the partnership's total average month-end estimated margin requirements. This information will provide you with a sense of the magnitude of each partnership's trading on non-U.S. exchanges, and, therefore, the relevance of the risks described in the prior paragraph to each partnership. You should be aware, however, that the percentage of each partnership's margin requirements that relates to positions on non-U.S. exchanges varies from month to month and can be significantly higher or lower than the percentages set forth below.
