Restrictions on Transfers or Assignments
While you may transfer or assign your units, the transferee or assignee may not become a limited partner without the written consent of the general partner. You may only withdraw capital or profits from a partnership by redeeming units. The general partner may withdraw any portion of its interest in a partnership that exceeds the amount required under the limited partnership agreement without prior notice to or consent of the limited partners. In addition, the general partner may withdraw or assign its entire interest in a partnership if it gives 120 days' prior written notice to the limited partners. If a majority of limited partners elect a new general partner or partners to continue the business of the partnership, the withdrawing general partner must pay all reasonable expenses incurred by the partnership in connection with its withdrawal.
Any transfer or assignment of units by you will take effect at the end of the month in which the transfer or assignment is made, subject to the following conditions. A partnership is not required to recognize a transfer or assignment until it has received at least 30 days' prior written notice from the limited partner. The notice must be signed by the limited partner and include the address and social security or taxpayer identification number of the transferee or assignee and the number of units transferred or assigned. A transfer or assignment of less than all units held by you cannot occur if as a result either party to the transfer or assignment would own fewer than the minimum number of units required for an investment in the partnership (subject to certain exceptions relating to gifts, death, divorce, or transfers to family members or affiliates). The general partner will not permit a transfer or assignment of units unless it is satisfied that the transfer or assignment would not be in violation of Delaware law or applicable federal, state, or foreign securities laws; and notwithstanding such transfer or assignment, the partnership will continue to be classified as a partnership rather than as an association taxable as a corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No transfer or assignment of units will be effective or recognized by a partnership if the transfer or assignment would result in the termination of that partnership for federal income tax purposes, and any attempt to transfer or assign units in violation of the limited partnership agreement will be ineffective. The limited partner must pay all costs, including any attorneys' and accountants' fees, related to a transfer or assignment.
Amendments; Meetings
Each limited partnership agreement may be amended by the general partner and by limited partners owning more than 50% of the units of that partnership. In addition, the general partner may make certain amendments to a limited partnership agreement without the consent of the limited partners, including any amendment that is not adverse to the limited partners or is required by the staff of the SEC, the CFTC, any other federal agency, any state "Blue Sky" official, or other governmental official, or to comply with applicable law. However, no amendment may be made to a limited partnership agreement without the consent of all partners affected if that amendment would reduce the capital account of any partner, modify the percentage of profits, losses, or distributions to which any partner is entitled, or change or alter the provisions of the limited partnership agreement relating to amendments requiring the consent of all partners.
Upon written request to the general partner delivered either in person or by certified mail, you or your authorized attorney or agent may obtain a list of the names and addresses of, and units owned by, all limited partners in your partnership, provided that you pay reasonable duplicating and postage costs. Limited partners owning at least 10% of the units of a partnership may request a meeting to consider any matter upon which limited partners may vote. Upon receipt of such a request, the general partner must call a meeting of that partnership, by written notice sent by certified mail or delivered in person within 15 days of the request. The meeting must be held at least 30 but not more than 60 days after the mailing by the general partner of notice of the meeting. The notice must specify the date, a reasonable place and time, and the purpose of the meeting.
