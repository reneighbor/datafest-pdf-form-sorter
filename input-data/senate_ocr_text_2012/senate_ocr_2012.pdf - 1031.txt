THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. Each Fund and the Master Fund are governed by a Board of Directors (each, a "Board"), which is responsible for protecting the interests of the Partners under the 1940 Act. At least a majority of the members of each Board are independent directors. A Board is elected by its Partners and meets periodically throughout the year to oversee the applicable Fund's business, review its performance, and review the actions of the Investment Manager. "BOARDS OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS" in the SAI identifies the Directors and officers of each Fund and the Master Fund and provides more information about them.
The Offshore Fund has two members, the TEI Fund and the Investment Manager (which holds only a nominal non-voting interest). The TEI Fund is the managing member of the Offshore Fund, and the non-managing member has delegated the day-to-day management and general oversight responsibilities of the Offshore Fund to the TEI Fund. The Offshore Fund therefore is effectively controlled by the Board of the TEI Fund.
THE INVESTMENT MANAGER. Hatteras Investment Partners, LLC (the "Investment Manager") is responsible for providing day-to-day investment management services to the Master Fund, subject to the ultimate supervision of and any policies established by the Board, pursuant to the terms of an investment management agreement with the Master Fund (the "Investment Management Agreement").
Under the Investment Management Agreement, the Investment Manager is responsible for developing, implementing and supervising the Master Fund's investment program. The Investment Manager is controlled by David B. Perkins, Founder and Chairman of Hatteras Funds. The Investment Manager along with its affiliated entities (collectively referred to as "Hatteras Funds") is a provider of unique alternative investment solutions for financial advisors and their clients. Hatteras Funds believes that all investors should have access to the same sophisticated investment approach and superior portfolio management talent as the largest institutions. A boutique alternative investment specialist founded in 2003, Hatteras Funds offers a suite of innovative products designed to solve specific portfolio needs.
As of March 31, 2011, the Investment Manager and its affiliates had assets under management of approximately $ 1.95 billion.
