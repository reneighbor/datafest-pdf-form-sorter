FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY
You should be aware that the general partner has a fiduciary duty under the limited partnership agreements and the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act to exercise good faith and fairness in all dealings affecting the partnerships. The limited partnership agreements do not permit the general partner to limit, by any means, the fiduciary duty it owes to investors. In the event that you believe the general partner has violated its responsibilities, you may seek legal relief under the Partnership Act, the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended, applicable federal and state securities laws, and other applicable laws. Each trading advisor also has a fiduciary duty under applicable law to the partnership it advises.
The limited partnership agreements, the customer agreements, and the selling agreement generally provide that the general partner, the commodity brokers, the selling agents, and their affiliates shall not be liable to a partnership or its investors for any act or omission by or on behalf of the partnership which the general partner, the commodity brokers, the selling agents, or their affiliates, as applicable,.determines in good faith to be in the best interests of the partnership, unless the act or omission constituted misconduct or negligence.
Under the limited partnership agreements, the customer agreements, and the selling agreement, each partnership has generally agreed to indemnify and defend the general partner, the commodity brokers, the selling agents and their affiliates, against any loss, liability, damage, cost, or expense (including attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses) they incur which arises from acts or omissions undertaken by or on behalf of the partnership, including claims by investors. These indemnities apply where the general partner, the commodity brokers, the selling agents or their affiliates, as applicable, has determined, in good faith, that the act or omission was in the best interests of the partnership, and the act or omission was not the result of misconduct or negligence. Payment of any indemnity by a partnership would reduce the net assets of that partnership. The partnerships do not carry liability insurance covering such potential losses or indemnification exposure.
No indemnification of the general partner, the commodity brokers, the selling agents, or their affiliates by a partnership is permitted for losses, liabilities, or expenses arising out of alleged violations of federal or state securities laws unless a court has found in favor of the indemnitee on the merits of the claim, or a court has dismissed the claim with prejudice on the merits, or a court has approved a settlement on the claim and found that the indemnification should be made by the partnership. Where court approval for indemnification is sought, the person claiming indemnification must advise the court of the views on indemnification of the SEC and the relevant state securities administrators. It is the opinion of the SEC that indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for directors, officers or controlling persons of a partnership or the general partner is against public policy and is therefore unenforceable. The CFTC has issued a statement of policy relating to indemnification of officers and directors of a futures commission merchant, such as the commodity brokers, and its controlling persons under which the CFTC has taken the position that whether such an indemnification is consistent with the policies expressed in the Commodity Exchange Act will be determined by the CFTC on a case-by-case basis. Each management agreement generally provides that trading advisor affiliates will not be liable to the partnership or the general partner or their partners, officers, shareholders, directors, or controlling persons. However, the trading advisor is liable for acts or omissions of the trading advisor or its affiliates if the act or omission constitutes a breach of the management agreement or a representation, warranty or covenant in the management agreement, constitutes willful misconduct or negligence, or is the result of such persons not having acted in good faith and in the reasonable belief that such actions or omissions were in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the partnership. Each trading advisor has specifically assumed financial responsibility for its errors in transmitting orders for the purchase or sale of futures interests; provided, that, in the case of Charter Aspect, the trading advisor is financially liable for human errors in inputting trading signals or communicating orders for execution that equal or exceed the greater of $50,000
