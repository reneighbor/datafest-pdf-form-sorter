For the period from September 15, 2006 to December 1, 2006 for Charter Aspect and the period from September 30, 2006 to December 1, 2006 for Charter WCM, all of Charter Aspect's assets and Charter WCM's assets were paid interest at the rate specified in the then-current Charter Series prospectus, with a limited partner's share of interest credited to its Units. No management, brokerage, or incentive fees were charged during this interim period, given the absence of futures interests trading by Charter Aspect and Charter WCM.

Use of Estimates — The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and related disclosures. Management believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of the financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Revenue Recognition — Futures Interests are open commitments until settlement date, at which time they are realized. They are valued at market on a daily basis and the resulting net change in unrealized gains and losses is reflected in the change in unrealized trading profit (loss) on open contracts from one period to the next on the Statements of Operations. Monthly, MS&Co. credits each Partnership with interest income on 100% of its average daily funds held at MS&Co. and MSIP to meet margin requirements at a rate approximately equivalent to what the commodity brokers pay other similar customers on margin deposits. In addition, MS&Co. credits at each month end each Partnership with interest income on 100% of such Partnership's assets not deposited as margin at a rate equal to the monthly average of the 4-week U.S. Treasury bill discount rate during the month. For purposes of such interest payments, Net Assets do not include monies owed to the Partnerships on forward contracts and other Futures Interests.
The Partnerships' functional currency is the U.S. dollar; however, the Partnerships may transact business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect at the date of the Statements of Financial Condition. Income and expense items denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates in effect during the period. Gains and losses resulting from the translation to U.S. dollars are reported in income currently.
Net Income (Loss) per Unit — Net income (loss) per unit of limited partnership interest ("Unit(s)") is computed using the weighted average number of Units outstanding during the period.
New Accounting Developments — In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes
