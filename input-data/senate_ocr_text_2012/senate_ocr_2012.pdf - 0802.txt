any other provision of the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner may, in order to prevent any such potential disclosure it determines in good faith is likely to occur, withhold certain information that would otherwise be provided to the Limited Partner under the Partnership Agreement. The public disclosure of all or a portion of such information, such as the disclosure of the Requested Information, would render the provisions of this confidentiality covenant, a form of which is standard market practice in the industry and by which every investor in the Partnership is bound, meaningless.
Given the foregoing, any disclosure by the Limited Partner or its affiliates of the Requested Information or the provision of the Requested Information by the General Partner would be directly at odds with the provisions of the Partnership Agreement and the best interests of the Limited Partner and the other investors in the Partnership.
This letter does not waive any rights the Partnership or General Partner may have under the Partnership Agreement, including the right to notification of any future request to disclose Partnership information.
Sincerely,
Trilantic Capital Partners Associates IV L.P.
