Redemption Charges Incurred by You
You will pay a redemption charge equal to 2% of the net asset value of the units redeemed if you redeem within the first 12 months after the units were purchased, and 1% if you redeem units within the 13th through the 24th month after the units were purchased. Units are not subject to a redemption charge after you have owned them for more than 24 months.
You will not incur a redemption charge if you redeem units during the first 24 months after they were issued in the following circumstances:
•	If you redeem units immediately following notice of an increase in brokerage, management or incentive fees.
•	If you redeem units in connection with an exchange for units in another Charter Series partnership.
•	If you acquire units with the proceeds from the redemption of interests in a non-Charter Series partnership for which Demeter Management Corporation serves as the general partner, you will not be subject to a redemption charge on those units when they are redeemed.
•	If you redeem units and use all or a portion of the proceeds of the redemption in a non-Charter Series exchange to purchase an interest in another limited partnership for which Demeter Management Corporation serves as general partner, you will not be subject to a redemption charge with respect to the proceeds used to purchase the interest in the other partnership. This is referred to as a Non-Series Exchange.
•	If you previously redeemed units and paid a redemption charge or held those units for at least 24 months, you will not have to pay a redemption charge on subsequently purchased units, provided they are purchased within 12 months of the redemption of the old units and the purchase price of the new units does not exceed the net proceeds received from the prior redemption.
Redemptions
Once you have been an investor in any Charter Series partnership for more than six months, you are permitted to redeem any part of your investment, even if subsequent purchases have been held for less than six months. However, you will pay a redemption charge of 2% of the net asset value redeemed if your redeemed units were purchased within 12 months of the date of redemption, and 1% if purchased within 13 to 24 months of the date of redemption. You will not be subject to a redemption charge after you have owned your units for more than 24 months. Unless you are redeeming your entire interest in a partnership, redemptions may only be made in whole units, with a minimum of 100 units required for each redemption.
Exchange Right
You may redeem units in any partnership after you have been an investor for six months and use the proceeds to purchase units in one or more of the other partnerships in the Charter Series (excluding Charter Campbell) at a price equal to 100% of the net asset value per unit, without incurring any redemption or other charge on the transaction.
Distributions
The general partner currently does not intend to make any distribution of partnership profits.
