•	If you redeem units in a Charter Series exchange, the units you redeem will not be subject to redemption charges and, for purposes of determining the applicability of future redemption charges, the units you acquire will be deemed to have the same purchase date as the units you exchanged.
•	If you redeem units of any other partnerships for which Demeter Management Corporation serves as the general partner, the units you redeem from the other limited partnership in the exchange will be subject to any applicable redemption charges, but the Charter Series units you acquire will not be subject to redemption charges.
•	If you redeem units and use all or a portion of the proceeds of the redemption in a Non-Series Exchange to purchase an interest in another limited partnership for which Demeter Management Corporation serves as general partner you will not be subject to a redemption charge with respect to the proceeds used to purchase the interest in the other partnerships.
•	If you redeem units and have either paid a redemption charge with respect to the units or held the units for at least twenty-four months, you will not be subject to redemption charges with respect to any newly-purchased units, provided the new units are purchased within twelve months of and in an amount no greater than the net proceeds of the prior redemption, and the units are held for at least six months from the date of purchase. In that event, you will still be subject to the minimum purchase and suitability requirements.
The general partner will endeavor to pay redemptions within ten business days after the redemption date. A partnership may be forced to liquidate open futures, forward, and options positions to satisfy redemptions in the event it does not have sufficient cash on hand that is not required as margin on open positions, and may delay payment to limited partners requesting redemption of units of the proportionate part of the net asset value of the units represented by the sums for which sufficient cash is not available. See "Risk Factors—Partnership and Offering Risks—Restricted investment liquidity in the units" on page 15. When you redeem units, payment will be made by credit to your customer account with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, or by check mailed to you if your account is closed. Your right to redeem units is contingent upon the redeeming partnership having assets sufficient to discharge its liabilities on the redemption date, and timely receipt by the general partner of your request for redemption as described above.
The terms and conditions applicable to redemptions in general, other than those prohibiting redemptions before the sixth month-end following the closing at which you first became an investor in a Charter Series partnership, and providing that redemptions may only be made as of the end of a calendar month, will also apply to redemptions effected on "special redemption dates." See "The Limited Partnership Agreements — Books and Records; Reports to Limited Partners" beginning on page 108.
