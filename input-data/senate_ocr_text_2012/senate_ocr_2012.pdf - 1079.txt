provided in this Agreement, (1) each Director is vested with the same powers and authority on behalf of the Partnership as are customarily vested in each director of a Delaware corporation and (2) each Independent Director is vested with the same powers and authority on behalf of the Partnership as are customarily vested in each director who is not an "interested person" (as that term is defined in the 1940 Act) of a closed-end, management investment company registered under the 1940 Act that is organized as a Delaware corporation. During any period in which the Partnership has no Directors, the General Partner will manage and control the Partnership. Each Director will be the agent of the Partnership but will not, for any purpose, be a General Partner. Notwithstanding the delegation described in this Section 3.1(a), the General Partner will not cease to be the General Partner and will continue to be liable as such and in no event will a Director be considered a General Partner by agreement, estoppel or otherwise as a result of the performance of his or her duties under this Agreement or otherwise. The General Partner retains those rights, powers and duties that have not been delegated under this Agreement. Any Director may be admitted to the Partnership in accordance with Section 2.7 of this Agreement and make Capital Contributions and own Units, in which case the Director will also become a Limited Partner.
(b)	The Partnership will file a tax return as a Partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. All decisions for the Partnership relating to tax matters including, without limitation, whether to make any tax elections (including the election under Section 754 of the Code), the positions to be made on the Partnership's tax returns and the settlement or further contest or litigation of any audit matters raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority, will be made by the Directors. All actions (other than ministerial actions) taken by the tax matters Partner, as designated in Section 3.1(c) below, will be subject to the approval of the Directors.
(c)	The General Partner will be the designated tax matters Partner for purposes of the Code. Each Partner agrees not to treat, on his, her or its personal income tax return or in any claim for a refund, any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit in a manner inconsistent with the treatment of the item by the Partnership. The tax matters Partner will have the exclusive authority and discretion to make any elections required or permitted to be made by the Partnership under any provisions of the Code or any other revenue laws.
(d)	No Limited Partner will have any right to participate in or take any part in the management or control of the Partnership's business, and no Limited Partner will have any right, power or authority to act for or bind the Partnership. Limited Partners will have the right to vote on any matters only as provided in this Agreement or on any matters that require the approval of the holders of voting securities under the 1940 Act and will have no right to exercise any other vote granted to Limited Partners under the Delaware Act, any such rights being vested in the Directors (or the General Partner if there are no Directors) and may be exercised without requiring the approval of the Limited Partners.
