REDEMPTIONS
Once you are an investor in a Charter Series partnership for at least six months, you may redeem all or part of your units, regardless of when such units were purchased. Redemptions may only be made in whole units, with a minimum of 100 units required for each redemption, unless you are redeeming your entire interest in a partnership. The general partner will redeem your units in the order in which they were purchased.
Redemptions will, only be effective as of the last day of the month in which a request for redemption in proper form has been timely received by the general partner. A "request for redemption" is a letter in the form specified by the general partner that must be sent by you to a local Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated branch office in time for it to be forwarded and received by the general partner no later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of the applicable monthly closing. A form of request for redemption is annexed to the limited partnership agreement, which agreement is annexed to this prospectus as Exhibit A. Additional copies of the request for redemption may be obtained by written request to the general partner or a local Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated branch office.
If you redeem units, you will receive 100% of the net asset value of each unit redeemed as of the redemption date, less any applicable redemption charges. Since you must deliver written notice to your Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated financial advisor who must forward the notice so that it will be received by the general partner no later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of the applicable monthly closing, you will not know the actual amount you are to receive prior to the redemption date. The "net asset value" of a unit is an amount equal to the partnership's net assets allocated to capital accounts represented by units, divided by the number of units outstanding. "Net Assets" means the total assets of a partnership, including ail cash and cash equivalents (valued at cost), accrued interest and amortization of original issue discount, and the market value of all open futures, forward, and options positions and other assets of the partnership, less the total liabilities of the partnership, including, but not limited to, all brokerage, management, and incentive fees, and ordinary administrative expenses, transaction fees and costs, if any, and extraordinary expenses, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied under the accrual basis of accounting. The market value of a futures contract traded on a U.S. exchange means the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on the day net assets are being determined. However, if a futures contract could not have been liquidated on that day because of the operation of daily limits or other rules of the exchange or otherwise, the settlement price on the first subsequent day on which the futures contract could be liquidated will be the market value of that futures contract for that day. The market value of a forward contract or a futures contract traded on a non-U.S, exchange or market means its market value as determined by the general partner on a basis consistently applied for each different variety of forward contract or futures interest.
If you redeem units on or prior to the last day of the twelfth month from the date of their purchase, those units will be subject to a redemption charge equal to 2% of their net asset value on the redemption date. If you redeem units after the last day of the twelfth month and on or prior to the last day of the twenty-fourth month from the date of their purchase, those units will be subject to a redemption charge equal to 1% of their net asset value on the redemption date. If you redeem units after the last day of the twenty-fourth month from the date of purchase, those units will not be subject to a redemption charge. All redemption charges will be paid to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and will not be shared with the financial advisor or additional selling agent who sold the units.
Your units will be exempt from redemption charges under the following circumstances:
• If you redeem units at the first redemption date following notice of an increase in brokerage, management, or incentive fees, those units will not be subject to redemption charges.
