agent of the Partnership but will not, for any purpose, be a General Partner. Notwithstanding the delegation described in this Section 3.1(a), the General Partner will not cease to be the General Partner and will continue to be liable as such and in no event will a Director be considered a General Partner by agreement, estoppel or otherwise as a result of the performance of his or her duties under this Agreement or otherwise. The General Partner retains those rights, powers and duties that have not been delegated under this Agreement. Any Director may be admitted to the Partnership in accordance with Section 2.7 of this Agreement and make Capital Contributions and own Units, in which case the Director will also become a Limited Partner.
(b)	The Partnership will file a tax return as a Partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. All decisions for the Partnership relating to tax matters including, without limitation, whether to make any tax elections (including the election under Section 754 of the Code), the positions to be made on the Partnership's tax returns and the settlement or further contest or litigation of any audit matters raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority, will be made by the Directors. All actions (other than ministerial actions) taken by the tax matters Partner, as designated in Section 3.1(c) below, will be subject to the approval of the Directors.
(c)	The General Partner will be the designated tax matters Partner for purposes of the Code. Each Partner agrees not to treat, on his, her or its personal income tax return or in any claim for a refund, any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit in a manner inconsistent with the treatment of the item by the Partnership. The tax matters Partner will have the exclusive authority and discretion to make any elections required or permitted to be made by the Partnership under any provisions of the Code or any other revenue laws.
(d)	No Limited Partner will have any right to participate in or take any part in the management or control of the Partnership's business, and no Limited Partner will have any right, power or authority to act for or bind the Partnership. Limited Partners will have the right to vote on any matters only as provided in this Agreement or on any matters that require the approval of the holders of voting securities under the 1940 Act and will have no right to exercise any other vote granted to Limited Partners under the Delaware Act, any such rights being vested in the Directors (or the General Partner if there are no Directors) and may be exercised without requiring the approval of the Limited Partners.
Section 3.2 Powers Reserved by the General Partner. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the General Partner retains all rights, duties and powers to manage die affairs of the Partnership that may not be delegated under Delaware law, and that are not otherwise delegated by the General Partner to the Directors or assumed by any investment manager engaged pursuant to Section 3.1(a) of this Agreement or any other Person
