represents more than 10% of an Adviser Fund's assets. For purposes of this calculation, an Adviser Fund's assets shall be deemed to include the assets in all of the Adviser's accounts that are managed using a strategy substantially similar to the Adviser Fund.
ALLOCATION AMONG INVESTMENT STRATEGIES. The allocation ranges are generally intended to be as follows during normal market conditions:
Range
Investment Strategy	Min.	Target	Max.
Hedge Fund Strategies		75%	
Opportunistic Equity ....................................	............................. 20%	30%	40%
Enhanced Fixed Income.................................	............................. 10%	20%	30%
Absolute Return ........................................	............................. 10%	15%	20%
Tactical Trading........................................	............................. 5%	10%	15%
Private Investment Strategy (1)		25%	
Private Investments .....................................	............................. 20%	25%	30%
(1) Securities issued by private partnerships may be more illiquid than securities issued by other Adviser Funds generally, because such partnerships' underlying investments may tend to be less liquid than other types of investments. The Investment Manager anticipates that attractive opportunities to invest in such partnerships will typically occur only periodically, as the Advisers in this investment strategy often only raise capital for new partnerships when existing partnerships are substantially invested.
INVESTMENT MANAGER'S RIGHT TO ALTER ALLOCATION RANGES. Subject to the Limited Partnership Agreement of each Fund, the Investment Manager may, in its discretion, change or modify the allocation ranges from time to time.
DUE DILIGENCE AND SELECTION OF ADVISERS
GENERAL. It is the responsibility of the Investment Manager to research and identify Advisers, to satisfy itself as to the suitability of the terms and conditions of the Adviser Funds and to allocate or reallocate the Master Fund's assets among Advisers and investment strategies. In the event that the Master Fund has one or more sub-advisers, it is also the responsibility of the Investment Manager to negotiate the investment subadvisory agreements, subject to requisite approval by the Partners or SEC exemptive relief from such requirements. There can be no assurance that the Funds will seek, or that the SEC will grant, such exemptive relief. The Investment Manager allocates the Master Fund's assets among Advisers using the diverse knowledge and experiences of the Investment Committee members to assess the capabilities of the Advisers and to determine an appropriate mix of investment strategies, sectors and styles given the prevailing economic and investment environment. The Advisers with which the Master Fund invests may pursue various investment strategies and are subject to special risks. See "RISK FACTORS — GENERAL RISKS" and "RISK FACTORS — INVESTMENT-RELATED RISKS."
PROCESS OF PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION. The Investment Manager generally intends to employ a multi-step process in structuring and monitoring the Master Fund's portfolio.
Step I: The Investment Manager will attempt to develop a pool of potential Adviser Funds to consider for investment. The Investment Committee will use its expertise and contacts in the investment management industry, along with third party publications and databases, to gain coverage of relevant investment opportunities across strategies, sectors, risk tolerances and objectives.
Step 2: The Investment Committee will attempt to identify potential Adviser Funds based on quantitative, qualitative, or due diligence criteria. In its quantitative consideration of potential investments, the Investment Manager may undertake a variety of analyses to screen prospective Adviser Funds. Quantitative considerations may include, among other things, an analysis of each Adviser Fund's return, risk (as measured by the volatility of a prospective Adviser Fund's returns), drawdowns (any period during which a prospective Adviser Fund's value is below its previous highest value; that is, any period during which it has suffered a loss), and correlations (the statistical relationship between a prospective Adviser Fund's return and the return of other Adviser Funds or certain markets) on both an individual basis and relative to its associated strategy. In addition, the Investment Manager may consider certain historical portfolio information for each prospective Adviser Fund.
The potential Adviser Funds may also be evaluated on the basis of certain qualitative or due diligence criteria. Qualitative J^jjj considerations may include, among other things, organizational profile, assets under management, quality and experience of key investment personnel, depth and continuity of the investment team, quality of administrative systems and support staff, ability to j-gjj implement strategies, and a consideration of various risk control philosophies employed by the various Advisers.
qgj, Step 3: Once a broad pool of potential Adviser Funds has been identified, the Investment Committee then determines an (gj) allocation for the Master Fund's assets across the pool, consistent with the allocation ranges then in effect. In creating the Master
