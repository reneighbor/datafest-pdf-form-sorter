Trading Strategy of Winton: Effective December 1, 2006
The Winton trading program engages in the speculative trading of futures and forward contracts on the global markets. The trading system tracks the daily price movements from the markets around the world and carries out certain computations to determine each day how long or short the portfolio should be to maximize profit within a certain range of risk.
The Winton trading system has been developed by relating the probability of the size and direction of future price movements with certain oscillators derived from past price performance which characterize the degree of trending of each market at any time. While this is, to some degree, true of all trend-following systems, the unique edge possessed by the Winton system lies In the quality of the analysis underlying the relationship. This enables the trading system to suffer smaller losses during the Inevitable whipsaw periods of market behavior and thus take better advantage of the significant trends when they occur, by focusing more resources on them.
