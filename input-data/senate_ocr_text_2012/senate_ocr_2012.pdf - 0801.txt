Dear Limited Partner,	Pa§e 14
This letter is in response to the email we received from Christopher W. Dewhurst dated January 19, 2012 informing us of a request by the Select Committee of Ethics of the U.S. Senate (the "Requesting Party") for the disclosure by Mr. David H. Dewhurst of certain confidential information (the "Requested Information") with respect to the investment by [the David Dewhurst Trust] (the "Limited Partner") in Trilantic Capital Partners IV L.P. (the "Partnership") on Mr. Dewhurst's public financial disclosure report for the U.S. Senate. Each capitalized term used and not defined in this letter shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Third Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of the Partnership (the "Partnership Agreement").

In addition, to the extent that any statutory or regulatory requirement similar to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, would potentially cause the Limited Partner or any of its affiliates to disclose information relating to the Partnership, its affiliates and/or any Portfolio Company, the Limited Partner is required by Section 11.2 to take commercially reasonable steps to oppose and prevent the requested disclosure of information (unless the General Partner does not object in writing within ten business days of receiving notice thereof or such disclosure solely relates to fund level, aggregate performance information) and, notwithstanding
