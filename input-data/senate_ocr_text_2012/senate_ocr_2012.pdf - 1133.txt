the Partnership and that the indemnitee is not liable to the Partnership or its Partners by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the indemnitee's office, or (2) the Directors secure a written opinion of independent legal counsel, based upon a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), to the effect that indemnification would not protect the indemnitee against any liability to the Partnership or its Partners to which the indemnitee would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the indemnitee's office.
(d)	Any indemnification or advancement of expenses made in accordance with this Section 3.8 will not prevent the recovery from any indemnitee'of any amount if the indemnitee subsequently is determined in a final judicial decision on the merits in any action, suit, investigation or proceeding involving the liability or expense that gave rise to the indemnification or advancement of expenses to be liable to the Partnership or its Partners by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the indemnitee's office. In any suit brought by an indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification under this Section 3.8, it will be a defense that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct described in this Section 3.8. In any suit in the name of the Partnership to recover any indemnification or advancement of expenses made in accordance with this Section 3.8, the Partnership will be entitled to recover the expenses upon a final adjudication from which no further right of appeal may be taken. In any suit brought to enforce a right to indemnification or to recover any indemnification or advancement of expenses made in accordance with this Section 3.8, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to any indemnification or advancement of expenses, under this Section 3.8 will be on the Partnership (or any Partner acting derivatively or otherwise on behalf of the Partnership or its Partners).
(e)	An indemnitee may not satisfy any right of indemnification or advancement of expenses granted in this Section 3.8 or to which he, she or it may otherwise be entitled except out of the assets of the Partnership, and no Partner will be personally liable with respect to any such claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses.
(f)	The rights of indemnification provided in this Section 3.8 will not be exclusive of or affect any other rights to which any Person may be entitled by contract or otherwise under law. Nothing contained in this Section 3.8 will affect the power of the Partnership to purchase and maintain liability insurance on behalf of any General Partner, any Director, the Investment Manager or other Person.
