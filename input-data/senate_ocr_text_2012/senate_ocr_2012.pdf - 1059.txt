Section 731(c)(3)(C)(i) and the recipient is an "eligible partner" within the meaning of Section 731(c)(3)(C)(iii). The Fund will determine at the appropriate time whether they qualify as an "investment partnership." Assuming they so qualify, if a Partner is an "eligible partner," which term should include a Partner whose contributions to the Fund consisted solely of cash and/or securities, the recharacterization rule described above would not apply.
In determining whether, if at all, the Fund should distribute stocks or securities to a particular Partner, the General Partner intends to attempt to take into account the tax consequences to the Fund and the remaining Partners, as well as the desirability of making the distribution in light of the Fund's investment program.
Foreign Taxes
It is possible that certain dividends and interest received by the Master Fund from sources within foreign countries will be subject to withholding taxes imposed by those countries. In addition, the Master Fund may also be subject to capital gains taxes in some of the foreign countries where it purchases and sells securities. Tax treaties between certain countries and the United States may reduce those taxes. It is impossible to predict in advance the rate of foreign tax the Master Fund will pay, because the amount of the Master Fund's assets to be invested in various countries is not known.
Each Partner in the Core Alternatives Fund will be informed of the Partner's proportionate share of the foreign taxes paid by the Master Fund, which the Partner , will be required to include in income for federal income tax purposes. The Partners generally will be entitled to claim either a credit (subject, however, to various limitations on foreign tax credits) or, if they itemize their deductions, a deduction (subject to the limitations generally applicable to deductions) for their share of such foreign taxes in computing their federal income taxes. A Partner that is tax-exempt will not ordinarily benefit from such credit or deduction.
Unrelated Business Taxable Income
Generally, an exempt organization (including, for example, a charity or a tax-qualified retirement plan) is exempt from federal income tax on its passive investment income, such as dividends, interest and capital gains, whether realized by the organization directly or indirectly through a partnership in which it is a partner.1 This type of income is exempt even if it is realized from securities trading activity that constitutes a trade or business.
This general exemption from tax does not apply to the UBTI of an exempt organization. Generally, except as noted above with respect to certain categories of exempt trading activity, UBTI includes income or gain derived (either directly or through a partnership) from a trade or business, the conduct of which is substantially unrelated to the exercise or performance of the organization's exempt purpose or function. With respect to investments in partnerships (and other entities classified as partnerships for federal income tax purposes) engaged in a trade or business other than securities trading, the Master Fund's income (or loss) from these investments may constitute UBTI.
UBTI also includes "unrelated debt-financed income," which generally consists of (1) income derived by an exempt organization (directly or through a partnership) from income-producing property with respect to which there is "acquisition indebtedness" at any time during the taxable year, and (2) gains derived by an exempt organization (directly or through a partnership) from the disposition of property with respect to which there is "acquisition indebtedness" at any time during the twelve-month period ending with the date of such disposition. "Acquisition indebtedness" may include both debt incurred by the exempt organization to finance its investment in the Fund and debt incurred by the Master Fund.
The Master Fund may incur "acquisition indebtedness" with respect to certain of its transactions, such as the purchase of securities on margin. Based upon a published ruling issued by the Service that generally holds that income and gain with respect to short sales of publicly traded stock does not constitute income from debt financed property for purposes of computing UBTI, the Master Fund will treat its short sales of securities as not involving "acquisition indebtedness" and therefore not resulting in UBTI.2 To the extent the Master Fund recognizes income (i.e., dividends and interest) from securities with respect to which there is "acquisition indebtedness" during a taxable year, the percentage of such income that will be treated as UBTI generally will be based on the percentage that the "average acquisition indebtedness" incurred with respect to such securities is of the "average amount of the adjusted basis" of such securities during the taxable year. Indebtedness incurred by an exempt organization to acquire or to carry its investment in the Fund will also be treated as "acquisition indebtedness" for these purposes.
1	With certain exceptions, tax-exempt organizations that are private foundations are subject to a 2% federal excise tax on their "net investment income." The rate of the excise tax for any taxable year may be reduced to 1% if the private foundation meets certain distribution requirements for the taxable year. A private foundation will be required to make payments of estimated tax with respect to this excise tax.
2	Moreover, income realized from option writing and futures contract transactions generally should not constitute UBTI.
