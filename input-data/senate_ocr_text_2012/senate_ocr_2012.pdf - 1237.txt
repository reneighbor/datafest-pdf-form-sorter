The descriptions of each trading advisor, its trading programs and its principals are general and are not intended to be exhaustive. It is not possible to provide a precise description of any trading advisor's trading program. Furthermore, each trading advisor may refer to specific aspects of its trading programs, which aspects may also be applicable to other trading advisors that did not choose to make specific reference to these aspects of their own trading programs. As a consequence, contrasts in the following descriptions may not, in fact, indicate a substantive difference between the different programs involved. However, all non-proprietary information about a trading program that the trading advisor believes to be material has been included.
A trading advisor's registration with the CFTC or its membership in the National Futures Association should not be taken as an indication that any such agency has recommended or approved the trading advisor.
Except as noted below, the trading advisors and their principals have no affiliation with any futures commission merchant, introducing broker, or principal thereof, and do not and will not participate in brokerage commissions, directly or indirectly. As of the date of this prospectus, none of the trading advisors or any principal of a trading advisor beneficially owns any units in any partnership.
