Additions to Public Disclosure Statement
Dear Mr. Sassaman:
Please note that my U.S. Senate campaign has been put on indefinite hold, and I am now running for the Texas State Senate. Please excuse the delay in responding to your letter.
In response to your inquiry dated January 19, 2012, please accept the following:
1.	Part II/Part IIIB. The Jones Law Firm is my husband's law firm, and he is the only principal; i.e., it is a sole proprietorship. All income is reported as earned income; therefore, no entry on Part IIB is applicable.
2.	Part IIIA. We have no reportable assets as described in your letter, except checking accounts that have a total of less than $20,000 as of the close of the reporting period.
3.	a. The underlying assets of the Elizabeth A. Jones Irrevocable Trust were various interests in oil and gas properties (I believe all working interests) that were all transferred to ITX Energy Ltd. as of November 20, 2010.
b. The location of ITX Energy Ltd. is San Antonio, Texas.
4.	The repayment terms of the items that were without terms have been filled in on the attached Part VII.
Please call Will C. Jones IV if you have any questions. His number is 512-391-9292.
Sincerely yours,
.Hju—
Elizabeth A. Jones
