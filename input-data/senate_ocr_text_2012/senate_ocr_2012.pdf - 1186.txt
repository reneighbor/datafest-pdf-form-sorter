Employees of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated are compensated based upon your investment and redemption decisions.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated as commodity broker pays a significant portion of the brokerage fees it receives from each partnership to its employees for providing continuing assistance to limited partners. Therefore, because Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorp orated's employees are directly compensated based on your decision to purchase and retain units in a partnership, they have a conflict of interest when advising you to purchase or redeem units in a partnership.
The selection of a trading advisor may benefit Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated as commodity broker.
The general partner is responsible for selecting and replacing, if necessary, each trading advisor. However, since selecting trading advisors who engage in a high volume of trades will increase commodity broker costs, without necessarily increasing revenue, the general partner has an incentive to select trading advisors who trade less frequently.
Affiliates of the general partner, the trading advisors, and the commodity brokers may trade for their own accounts in competition with the partnerships.
The general partner does not trade futures, forwards, and options for its own account, but officers, directors, and employees of the general partner, the commodity brokers, the foreign currency forward and options counterparties and the trading advisors and their affiliates, principals, officers, directors, and employees, may trade futures, forwards, and options for their own proprietary accounts. Their trading records will not be available to you. As a result, you will not be able to compare the performance of their trading to the performance of the partnerships.
The commodity brokers are large futures commission merchants, handling substantial customer business in physical commodities and futures, forwards, and options. Thus, the commodity brokers may effect transactions for the account of a partnership in which the other parties to such transactions are employees or affiliates of the general partner, a trading advisor, the commodity brokers, or customers or correspondents of the commodity brokers. These persons might also compete with a partnership in bidding on purchases or sales of futures, forwards, and options without knowing that the partnership is also bidding. It is possible that transactions for these other persons might be effected when similar trades for one or more partnerships are not executed or are executed at less favorable prices.
The trading advisors manage other accounts that will compete with the partnerships.
•	Each trading advisor manages other accounts trading futures, forwards, and options, in addition to the partnership's accounts. Each trading advisor must aggregate futures and options positions in other accounts managed by it with futures and options positions in the applicable partnership's account for speculative position limit purposes. This may require a trading advisor to liquidate or modify positions for all of its accounts, which could adversely affect the partnership's performance.
•	Each trading advisor currently may manage accounts that pay fees higher than the fees paid by the partnerships. A trading advisor will have a conflict of interest in rendering advice to a partnership because the compensation it receives for managing another account exceeds the compensation it receives for managing the partnership's account.
•	If a trading advisor makes trading decisions for other accounts and a partnership's account at or about the same time, the partnership may be competing with those other accounts for the same or similar positions.
•	The trading advisors' records for these other accounts will not be made available to you. As a result, you will not be able to compare the performance of these accounts to the performance of the partnerships.
