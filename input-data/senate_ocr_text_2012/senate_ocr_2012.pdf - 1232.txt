Morgan Stanley has contributed to the general partner the capital necessary to permit the general partner to meet its net worth obligations as general partner of each partnership and intends to continue to do so.

Based on its observations and in consultation with the trading advisors, the general partner may agree to changes, including changing the allocation of assets among the trading programs and the leverage at which a partnership's assets are traded. The general partner must approve the category of contracts that are traded by the partnerships, but not each individual trade.
