(c) Controversies will be finally settled by, and only by, arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") to the fullest extent permitted by law. The place of arbitration will be Raleigh, North Carolina. Any arbitration under this Section 8.5 will be conducted before a panel of three arbitrators. The Partner or Partners initiating arbitration under this Section 8.5 will appoint one arbitrator in the demand for arbitration. The Partner or Partners against whom or which arbitration is sought will jointly appoint one arbitrator within 30 Business Days after notice from the AAA of the filing of the demand for arbitration. The two arbitrators nominated by the Partners will attempt to agree on a third arbitrator within 30 Business Days of the appointment of the second arbitrator. If the two arbitrators fail to agree on the third arbitrator within the 30-day period, then the AAA will appoint the third arbitrator within 30 Business Days following the expiration of the 30-day period. Any award rendered by the arbitrators will be final and binding on the Partners, and judgment upon the award may be entered in the supreme court of the state of New York and/or the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, or any other court having jurisdiction over the award or having jurisdiction over the Partners or their assets. The arbitration agreement contained in this Section 8.5 will not be construed to deprive any court of its jurisdiction to grant provisional relief (including by injunction or order of attachment) in aid of arbitration proceedings or enforcement of an award. In the event of arbitration as provided in this Section 8.5, the arbitrators will be governed by and will apply the substantive (but not procedural) law of Delaware, to the exclusion of the principles of the conflicts of law of Delaware. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the procedures set out in the commercial arbitration rules of the AAA. If those rules are silent with respect to a particular matter, the procedure will be as agreed by the Partners, or in the absence of agreement among or between the Partners, as established by the arbitrators. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this Section 8.5(c) will be construed to the maximum extent possible to comply with the laws of the State of Delaware, including the Uniform Arbitration Act (10 Del. C ss. 5701 et seq.) (the "Delaware Arbitration Act"). If, nevertheless, it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction that any provision or wording of this Section 8.5(c), including any rules of the AAA, are invalid or unenforceable under the Delaware Arbitration Act or other applicable law, such invalidity will not invalidate all of this Section 8.5(c). In that case, this Section 8.5(c) will be construed so as to limit any term or provision so as to make it valid or enforceable within the requirements of the Delaware Arbitration Act or other applicable law, and, in the event such term or provision cannot be so limited, this Section 8.5(c) will be construed to omit such invalid or unenforceable provision.
