principal activity of each partnership consists of buying and selling futures, options, and forward contracts, and at least 90% of the partnership's gross income during each year consists of gains from such trading and interest income. No ruling has been requested from the Internal Revenue Service with respect to classification of each partnership and the general partner does not intend to request such a ruling.
If a partnership were treated as an association (or a publicly traded partnership) taxable as a corporation, income or loss of the partnership would not be passed through to its partners, and the partnership would be subject to tax on its income at the rates applicable to corporations without deductions for any distributions to its partners. In addition, aU or a portion of any distributions by such partnership to its partners could be taxable to the partners as dividends or capital gains. The discussion that follows assumes that each partnership will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.
Partnership Taxation
Partners, rather than a Partnership, are Subject to Federal Income Tax. None of the partnerships will pay federal income tax. Except as provided below with respect to certain nonresident aliens, each limited partner will report his distributive share of all items of partnership income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit for the partnership's taxable year ending within or with the partner's taxable year. A limited partner must report and pay tax on his share of partnership income for a particular year whether or not he has received any distributions from the partnership in that year. The characterization of an item of profit or loss will usually be determined at the partnership level.
Syndication Expenses. None of the partnerships nor any partner thereof will be entitled to any deduction for syndication expenses (i.e., those amounts paid or incurred in connection with issuing and marketing units). There is a risk that some of the brokerage fees paid to the commodity broker could be treated as a nondeductible payment by the partnerships of syndication expenses.
Allocation of Partnership Profits and Losses. In general, each limited partnership allocates items of ordinary income and expense pro rata among the partners based upon their respective capital accounts as of the end of the month in which such items are accrued. Net recognized capital gain or loss is generally allocated among all partners based upon their respective capital accounts. However, recognized capital gain or loss is allocated first to partners who have redeemed units in the partnership during a taxable year to the extent of the difference between the amount received on the redemption and the allocation account as of the date of redemption attributable to the redeemed units. Any remaining recognized capital gain or loss is next allocated among all those partners whose capital accounts differ from their allocation accounts based on the respective differences for each partner.
The special allocation of each partnership's gain or loss upon a redemption of units, which retains the same character as in the hands of each partnership, may alter the character of a redeeming limited partner's income (by reducing the amount of long-term capital gain recognized upon receipt of redemption proceeds) and may accelerate the recognition of income by such limited partner.
These allocations are designed to reconcile tax allocations to economic allocations. However, the general partner cannot assure you that the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge such allocations, including each partnership's tax allocations in respect of redeemed units.
If the allocation provided by each limited partnership is not respected by the Internal Revenue Service for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of income or loss allocated to the partners for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be increased or reduced or the character of the income or loss may be modified.
