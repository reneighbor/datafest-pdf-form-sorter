THE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS
This section of the prospectus summarizes all material provisions of the limited partnership agreement of each partnership that are not discussed elsewhere in the prospectus. A form of the limited partnership agreements is annexed to this prospectus as Exhibit A. Each limited partnership agreement is identical, except as noted otherwise below or in Exhibit A.
Nature of the Partnerships
Each partnership was formed under Delaware law on July 15,1998, except that Charter Aspect was formed on October 22,1993. The fiscal year of each partnership begins on January 1 of each year and ends on the following December 31.
The units that you purchase and pay for in this offering will be fully paid and nonassessable. You may be liable to a partnership for liabilities that arose before the date of a redemption or Charter Series exchange. Your liability, however, will not exceed the sum of your unredeemed capital contribution, undistributed profits, if any, any distributions and amounts received upon a redemption or deemed received on a Charter Series exchange, together with interest on any such amount. However, a partnership will not make a claim against you for any amounts received in connection with a redemption of units or a Charter Series exchange unless the net assets of the partnership are insufficient to discharge the liabilities of the partnership that arose before any distributions were made to you. The general partner will be liable for all obligations of a partnership to the extent that assets of the partnership are insufficient to pay those obligations.
Management of Partnership Affairs
You will not participate in the management or operations of a partnership. Under each limited partnership agreement, the general partner is solely responsible for managing the partnership.
The general partner may use a partnership's funds only to operate the business of that partnership. The general partner may hire an affiliate to perform services for the partnership if the general partner determines that the affiliate is qualified to perform the services, and can perform those services under competitive terms that are fair and reasonable. Any agreement with an affiliate must be for a term not in excess of one year and be terminable by the partnership without penalty upon 60 days' prior written notice.
Other responsibilities of the general partner include:
•	determining whether a partnership will make a distribution;
•	administering redemptions and series exchanges;
•	preparing monthly and annual reports;
•	preparing and filing tax returns required for each partnership;
•	signing documents on behalf of each partnership and its limited partners pursuant to powers of attorney; and
•	supervising the liquidation of a partnership, if necessary.
Sharing of Profits and Losses
You will have a capital account in each partnership in which you invest, with an initial balance equal to the amount you paid for units of the partnership. The general partner also has a capital account. Each partnership's net assets will be calculated monthly, and your capital account will be adjusted as necessary to reflect any increases or decreases that may have occurred since the preceding month. The general partner and limited partners will share profits and losses in proportion to the size of their respective capital accounts. For a description of the federal tax allocations, see "Material Federal Income Tax Considerations — Partnership Taxation — Allocation of Partnership Profits and Losses" beginning on page 117.
