Further, an investment in bonds issued by foreign governments or corporations may carry significant geo-political risks, legal risks, currency risks (significant devaluations) and liquidity risks (lack of developed trading markets), among other things.
The Structured Credit strategy involves risks of investing in a CDO. The risks of an investment in a CDO depends largely on the type of the collateral securities and the class of the CDO in which an Adviser Fund invests. Normally, CBOs, CLOs and other CDOs are privately offered and sold, and thus are not registered under the securities laws. As a result, investments in CDOs may be characterized by an Adviser Fund as illiquid securities. However, an active dealer market may exist for CDOs, allowing a CDO to qualify for Rule 144A transactions. In addition to the normal risks associated with fixed-income securities and asset-backed securities, CDOs carry additional risks including, but not limited to: (i) the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments; (ii) the quality of the collateral may decline in value or default; (iii) an Adviser Fund may invest in tranches of CDOs that are subordinate to other tranches; (iv) the complex structure of the security may not be fully understood at the time of investment and may produce disputes with the issuer or unexpected investment results; and (v) the CDO's manager may perform poorly or default.
Although certain CDOs may receive credit enhancement in the form of a senior-subordinate structure, over-col lateralization or bond insurance, such enhancement may not always be present and may fail to protect an Adviser Fund against the risk of loss on default of the collateral. CDOs may use derivatives contracts to create "synthetic" exposure to assets rather than holding such assets directly, which entails the risks of derivative instruments.
Mortgage-backed securities may have significantly greater price and yield volatility than is the case with traditional fixed-income securities. As a result, if an Adviser Fund purchases mortgage-backed securities at a premium, a faster than expected prepayment rate will reduce both the market value and the yield to maturity from those which were anticipated. A prepayment rate that is slower than expected will have the opposite effect of increasing yield to maturity and market value. Conversely, if an Adviser Fund purchases mortgage-backed securities at a discount, faster than expected prepayments will increase, while slower than expected prepayments will reduce yield to maturity and market values. To the extent that an Adviser Fund invests in mortgage-backed securities, it may seek to manage these potential risks by investing in a variety of mortgage-backed securities and by using certain hedging techniques.
In addition, asset-backed securities present certain additional risks because asset-backed securities generally do not have the benefit of a security interest in collateral that is comparable to mortgage assets. Credit card receivables are generally unsecured and the debtors on such receivables are entitled to the protection of a number of state and federal consumer credit laws, many of which give such debtors the right to set-off certain amounts owed on the credit cards, thereby reducing the balance due. Automobile receivables generally are secured, but by automobiles rather than residential real property. Most issuers of automobile receivables permit the loan servicers to retain possession of the underlying obligations. If the servicer were to sell these obligations to another party, there is a risk that the purchaser would acquire an interest superior to that of the holders of the asset-backed securities. In addition, because of the large number of vehicles involved in a typical issuance and technical requirements under state laws, the trustee for the holders of the automobile receivables may not have a proper security interest in the underlying automobiles. Therefore, if the issuer of an asset-backed security defaults on its payment obligations, there is the possibility that, in some cases, an Adviser Fund will be unable to possess and sell the underlying collateral and that the Adviser Fund's recoveries on repossessed collateral may not be available to support payments on the securities.
ABSOLUTE RETURN
Event Driven Arbitrage is research intensive and requires continual review of announced and anticipated events. In addition, the analysis required differs significantly from conventional securities analysis, and many investors may be ill-equipped to analyze certain types of situations or respond to them in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that any hedging techniques employed by an Adviser will be successful or that the hedging employed by the Adviser will not have the negative effect of lowering overall returns, or creating losses, in the portfolio or with respect to the applicable position.
In regards to Convertible Arbitrage, the Investment Manager believes that it necessitates rigorous analysis to determine the portion of the value of the convertible security that is composed of equity-like elements and the portion that is composed of debt-like elements.
Merger Arbitrage is more cyclical than many other strategies, since it requires a supply of corporate mergers and acquisitions to deploy capital. For example, from the middle part of 2000 to the middle part of 2003, activity within this strategy was particularly limited. There can be no assurance that any such hedging techniques will be successful or that the hedging employed by the Adviser will not have the negative effect of lowering overall returns, or creating losses, in the portfolio or with respect to the applicable position.
