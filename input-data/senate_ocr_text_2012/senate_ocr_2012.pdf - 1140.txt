(d)	Units are expected to be repurchased at their net asset value determined as of approximately June 30, September 30, December 31 and March 31, as applicable (each such date, a "Valuation Date"). Partners tendering Units for repurchase shall provide written notice of their intent to so tender by the date specified in the Notice, which date shall be approximately 65 days prior to the date of repurchase by the Partnership. Partners tendering their Units may not have all such Units accepted for repurchase by the Partnership. The Partnership may elect to repurchase less than the full amount a Partner requests to be repurchased. If a repurchase offer is oversubscribed, the Partnership may repurchase only a pro rata portion of the amount tendered by each Partner.
(e)	The Directors may under certain circumstances elect to postpone, suspend or terminate an offer to repurchase Units.
(f)	A Limited Partner tendering only some of its Units for repurchase will be required to maintain a minimum capital account balance of $100,000. The Partnership may reduce the number of Units to be purchased from a Limited Partner to maintain the required minimum balance.

(h)	If a General Partner ceases to serve in that capacity under Section 4.1 of this Agreement (other than pursuant to Section 4.1(d)) and the business of the Partnership is continued in accordance with
Section 6.1(a)(2)(B) of this Agreement, the former General Partner (or its trustee or other legal representative) may, by written notice to the Directors within 60 days of the action resulting in the continuation of the Partnership under Section 6.1(a)(2)(B), tender to the Partnership all or any portion of its Units.
