If the redemption proceeds in a Non-Series Exchange from one of these partnerships are less than $5,000, the subscriber will have to pay the difference in cash.
If you are making a Non-Series Exchange, regardless of whether the $5,000 or the $20,000 minimum subscription for the Charter Series of partnerships requirement applies, you will be required to invest at least $5,000 in any Charter Series partnership for which you subscribe.
If you already own units in a partnership and you wish to make an additional investment in the same partnership or make an investment in any other Charter Series partnership, you may subscribe for units at a monthly closing with a minimum investment of:
•	in the case of a cash purchase, $1,000;
•	in the case of a Charter Series exchange, you must exchange a minimum of 100 units, unless you are liquidating your entire interest in a partnership; and
•	in the case of a Non-Series Exchange, the proceeds from the redemption of 1 unit from commodity pools other than the Spectrum Series of partnerships, or 100 units from one, or any combination, of the Spectrum Series of partnerships.
In order to make your first purchase of units of a partnership, other than by means of an exchange, you must complete, sign, and deliver to Morgan Stanley & Co, Incorporated a subscription agreement which will authorize the general partner and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated to transfer the full subscription amount from your Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated customer account to the partnerships' escrow account. If your subscription agreement is received by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and not immediately rejected, you must have the appropriate amount in your Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated customer account on the first business day following the date that your subscription agreement is received by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated. Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated will deduct the subscription amount from your customer account and transfer funds into escrow with the escrow agent on that date. If you do not have a Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated customer account or an account with an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, or do not have sufficient funds in your existing Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated customer account, you should make appropriate arrangements with your Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated financial advisor, or contact your local Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated branch office. Do not mail any payment to the general partner, as it will be returned to you for proper placement with the Morgan Stanley & Co, Incorporated branch office where your account is maintained.
