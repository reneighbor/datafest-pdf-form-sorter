During the five years preceding the date of this prospectus, there have been no material administrative, civil or criminal actions, including actions pending, on appeal or concluded, against Graham or its principals.
Graham and its principals may, from time to time, trade futures, forward, or options contracts for their own proprietary accounts. These accounts may take positions that are opposite, or ahead of, positions advocated for clients. Such trades may or may not be in accordance with the Graham trading programs described below, Although Graham maintains records of these trades, clients of Graham are not entitled to inspect these records except in certain limited circumstances. Graham may place block orders with a brokerage firm on behalf of multiple accounts, including accounts in which Graham or its principals have an interest. If Graham or its principals place the same trade orders for their accounts as they do for their clients in a single block order with a brokerage firm, the brokerage firm allocates the trade fill prices assigned to each account in a manner consistent with that firm's policy. Unless an average price of split fills is allocated, split fills generally are allocated to accounts on a "high to low" basis — accounts are ranked based on commencement of trading, and the highest split fill prices are allocated to the highest-ranked accounts. Therefore, any advantage a high-ranked account enjoys on a sell order generally is offset by its disadvantage on the buy order.
