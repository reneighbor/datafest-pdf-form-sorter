right of redemption, and shall remain subject to the other terms of this Agreement binding upon Limited Partners. No Limited Partner shall have any right to approve of any person becoming a substituted Limited Partner. The Limited Partner shall bear all costs (including any attorneys' and accountants' fees) related to such transfer or assignment of his Units.
In the event that the General Partner consents to the admission of a substituted Limited Partner pursuant to this Section 10(a), the General Partner is hereby authorized to take such actions as may be necessary to reflect such substitution of a Limited Partner.
(b) Redemption. Except as set forth below and in accordance with the terms hereof, a Limited Partner (or any assignee thereof) may withdraw all or part of his unredeemed capital contribution and undistributed profits, if any, by requiring the Partnership to redeem all or part of his Units at the Net Asset Value thereof, reduced as hereinafter described (any such withdrawal being herein referred to as a "Redemption"). Redemptions may only be made in whole Units, with a minimum amount of 100 Units required for each redemption, unless a Limited Partner is redeeming his entire interest in the Partnership.
Except as otherwise provided in Section 6, Units may be redeemed at the option of a Limited Partner as of, but not before, the sixth month-end following the closing at which the Limited Partner first becomes a Limited Partner of the Partnership or a limited partner of any other partnership offering Units pursuant to the Prospectus (all such partnerships shall be defined collectively as the "Charter Series Partnerships" or individually as a "Charter Series Partnership"). Thereafter, Units may be redeemed as of the end of any month. However, any Unit redeemed at or prior to the end of the twelfth or twenty-fourth full month following the closing at which such Unit was issued will be assessed a redemption charge equal to 2% or 1%, respectively, of the Net Asset Value of a Unit on the date of such redemption. The foregoing charges will be paid to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated. A Limited Partner who purchased Units pursuant to a Non-Series Exchange (as defined in the Prospectus) will not be subject to the foregoing redemption charges with respect to such Units. The number of Units (determined on a per closing basis), expressed as a percentage of Units purchased, which is not subject to a redemption charge is determined by dividing (a) the dollar amount used in a Non-Series Exchange to purchase Units by (b) the total investment in the Partnership. Limited Partners who redeem units of limited partnership interest in a Charter Series Partnership and have either paid a redemption charge with respect to such units, or have held such units for at least two years and subsequently purchase Units, will not be subject to redemption charges on the new Units under the following conditions:
(a)	the subscriber must subscribe for new Units prior to the one-year anniversary of the effective date of the redemption of the units of limited partnership in the other Charter Series Partnership,
(b)	the subscriber will not be subject to redemption charges with respect to the amount of the subscription for the new Units up to the amount of the proceeds of the redemption (net of any redemption charges), and (c) the subscriber must hold the newly acquired Units for six months from the date of purchase before such Units may be redeemed or exchanged pursuant to a Series Exchange. Limited Partners who redeem Units and use all or a portion of the proceeds of the redemption in a Non-Series Exchange to purchase an interest in another limited partnership for which the General Partner serves as general partner will not be subject to a redemption charge with respect to the proceeds used to purchase the interest in the other partnership. The number of Units, expressed as a percentage of Units redeemed, which are not subject to a redemption charge is determined by dividing (a) the dollar amount of the other partnership interest purchased by (b) the dollar amount of the Units redeemed. Such subscribers remain subject to the minimum purchase and suitability requirements. In addition, redemption charges may not be imposed for certain large purchasers of units of limited partnership interest in the Charter Series Partnerships, as provided in the Prospectus. A Limited Partner who redeems Units pursuant to a Series Exchange will not be subject to redemption charges with respect to the redeemed Units. Units acquired pursuant to a Series Exchange will be deemed as having the same purchase date as the Units exchanged for purposes of determining the applicability of any redemption charges. Furthermore, a Limited Partner redeeming Units at the first Redemption Date following notice of an increase in certain fees in accordance with the fourth paragraph of Section 9 will not be subject to the foregoing redemption charges. Redemptions of Units will be deemed to be in the order in which they are purchased (assuming purchases at more than one closing), with the Units not subject to a redemption charge being deemed to be the first Units purchased at a closing.
