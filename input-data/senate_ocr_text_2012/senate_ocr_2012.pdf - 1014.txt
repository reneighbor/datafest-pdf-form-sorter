Investments in either of the Funds may be made only by "Eligible Investors" as defined herein. See "INVESTOR QUALIFICATIONS."
For convenience, reference to the Funds may include the Offshore Fund and the Master Fund as the context requires. Also, the Master Fund's investments may be referred to as investments with Advisers or Adviser Funds.
Units are an Illiquid Investment. The Units will not be listed on any securities exchange and the Funds will not knowingly permit a secondary market to develop. The Units are subject to substantial restrictions on transferability and resale and may not be transferred or resold except as permitted under the Partnership Agreements. Although each Fund may offer to repurchase Units from time to time, Units will not be redeemable at a Partner's option nor will they be exchangeable for Units or shares of any other fund. As a result, an investor may not be able to sell or otherwise liquidate his or her Units. Units are appropriate only for those investors who can tolerate a high degree of risk and do not require a liquid investment and for whom an investment in a Fund does not constitute a complete investment program.

The Units are being offered through the Distributor and may also be offered through other brokers or dealers that have entered into selling agreements with the Distributor. The Investment Manager, the Distributor and/or their affiliates may make payments to selected affiliated or unaffiliated third parties (including the parties who have entered into selling agreements with the Distributor) from time to time in connection with the distribution of Units and/or the servicing of Partners and/or the Fund. These payments will be made out of the Investment Manager's, Distributor's and/or affiliates' own assets and will not represent an additional charge to the Fund.
