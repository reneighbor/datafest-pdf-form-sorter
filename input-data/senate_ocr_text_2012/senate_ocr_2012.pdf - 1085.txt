(including for this purpose each officer, director, member, Partner, principal, employee or agent of, or any Person who controls, is controlled by or is under common control with, a General Partner (including, without limitation, Hatteras Investment Partners LLC) or Partner of a General Partner and their executors, heirs, assigns, successors or other legal representatives) and each Director (and his. executors, heirs, assigns, successors or other legal representatives) (each such Person being referred to as an "indemnitee") against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses arising by reason of being or having been a General Partner or Director of the Partnership, or the past or present performance of services to the Partnership by the indemnitee, except to the extent that the loss, claim, damage, liability, cost or expense has been finally determined in a judicial decision on the merits from which no further right to appeal may be taken in any such action, suit, investigation or other proceeding to have been incurred or suffered by the indemnitee by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the indemnitee's office. These losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses include, but are not limited to, amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise, or as fines or penalties, and counsel fees and expenses incurred in connection with the defense or disposition of any action, suit, investigation or other proceeding, whether civil or criminal, before any judicial, arbitral, administrative or legislative body, in which the indemnitee may be or may have been involved as a party or otherwise, or with which such indemnitee may be or may have been threatened, while in office or thereafter. The rights of indemnification provided under this Section 3.8 are not to be construed so as to provide for indemnification of an indemnitee for any liability (including liability under U.S. Federal securities laws which, under certain circumstances, impose liability even on Persons that act in good faith) to the extent (but only to the extent) that indemnification would be in violation of applicable law, but will be construed so as to effectuate the applicable provisions of this Section 3.8.
(b) Expenses, including counsel fees and expenses, incuned by any indemnitee (but excluding amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromise, or as fines or penalties) may be paid from time to time by the Partnership in advance of the final disposition of any action, suit, investigation or other proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnitee to repay to the Partnership amounts paid if a determination is made that indemnification of the expenses is not authorized under Section 3.8(a) of this Agreement, so long as (1) the indemnitee provides security for the undertaking, (2) the Partnership is insured by or on behalf of the indemnitee against losses arising by reason of the indemnitee's failure to fulfill his, her or its undertaking, or (3) a majority of the Independent Directors (excluding any Director who is either seeking advancement of expenses under this Agreement or is or has been a party to any other action, suit, investigation or other proceeding involving claims similar to those involved in the action, suit, investigation or proceeding giving rise to a claim for advancement of expenses under this Agreement) or independent legal counsel in a written opinion determines, based on a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), that reason exists to believe that the indemnitee ultimately will be entitled to indemnification.
