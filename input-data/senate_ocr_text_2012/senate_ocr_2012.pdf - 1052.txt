•	the economic condition of the securities markets and the economy generally as well as political, national or international developments or current affairs; and
•	the anticipated tax consequences to a Fund of any proposed repurchases of Units or portions thereof.
When a repurchase offer commences, the affected Fund will send a notification of the offer, in advance of such offer, to the Partners via their financial intermediaries. The notification will specify, among other things:
the percentage of Units that the Fund is offering to repurchase;
the date on which a Partner's repurchase request is due;
the Valuation Date (as defined below) applicable to the repurchase;
the date by which the Partners will receive the proceeds from their Unit sales; and
• the most current NAV of the Units that is available on the date of the notification, although such NAV may not be the NAV at which repurchases are made.
In each repurchase offer, each Fund intends to repurchase a percentage of its Units at its NAV, but in no event to exceed the repurchase of more than 20% of the Units per quarter. A Partner that participates in a repurchase offer with a Valuation Date (as defined below) occurring prior to the end of the 12th month of its admission to that Fund may be subject to a penalty payable to the Fund equal to 5% of the amount requested to be repurchased, to be netted against withdrawal proceeds. The minimum value of a repurchase is $50,000, subject to the discretion of the General Partner to allow otherwise. A Partner whose Units (or a portion thereof) are repurchased by a Fund will not be entitled to a return of any sales charge that was charged in connection with the Partner's purchase of the Units.
Units will be repurchased at their NAV determined as of approximately March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, as applicable (each such date, a "Valuation Date"). Partners tendering Units for repurchase will be asked to give written notice of their intent to do so by the date specified in the notice describing the terms of the applicable repurchase offer, which date will be approximately 65 days prior to the date of repurchase by each Fund. Partners who tender may not have all of the tendered Units repurchased by a Fund. If over-subscriptions occur, a Fund may elect to repurchase less than the full amount that a Partner requests to be repurchased. In such an event, the Funds may repurchase only a pro-rata portion of the amount tendered by each Partner.
The decision to offer to repurchase Units is in the complete and absolute discretion of the applicable Fund's Board, which may, under certain circumstances, elect not to offer to repurchase Units. In certain circumstances, the General Partner may require a Partner to tender its Units.
A Partner who tenders for repurchase only a portion of his Units in a Fund will be required to maintain a minimum account balance of $50,000. If a Partner tenders a portion of his Units and the repurchase of that portion would cause the Partner's account balance to fall below this required minimum (except as a result of proration), each Fund reserves the right to reduce the portion of the Units to be purchased from the Partner so that the required minimum balance is maintained. Such minimum capital account balance requirement may also be waived by the General Partner in its sole discretion, subject to applicable federal securities laws.
TENDER/REPURCHASE PROCEDURES
Due to liquidity restraints associated with the Master Fund's investments in Adviser Funds and the fact that the Funds will have to effect withdrawals from the Master Fund (for the TEI Fund, the withdrawal from the Master Fund will be via the Offshore Fund) to pay for Units being repurchased, it is presently expected that, under the procedures applicable to the repurchase of Units, Units will be valued as of the applicable Valuation Date. Each Fund will generally pay the value of the Units repurchased (or as discussed below, 95% of such value if all Units owned by a Partner are repurchased) approximately 90 days after the Valuation Date. This amount will be subject to adjustment within 45 days after completion of the annual audit of each Fund's financial statements for the fiscal year in which the repurchase is effected. Units may be repurchased prior to Adviser Fund audits. To mitigate any effects of this, if all Units owned by a Partner are repurchased, the Partner will receive an initial payment equal to 95% of the estimated value of the Units (after adjusting for fees, expenses, reserves or other allocations or redemption charges) within approximately 90 days after the Valuation Date, subject to audit adjustment, and the balance due will be determined and paid within 45 days after completion of each Fund's annual audit.
