the soybean meal, wheat, corn, soybeans, coffee, sugar, live cattle, soybean oil, cotton, and cocoa markets. Supply and demand inequalities, severe weather disruptions, and market expectations affect price movements in these markets.
Energy. The third largest market exposure of the partnership at December 31, 2007, was to the energy sector. The partnership's energy exposure was primarily to futures contracts in crude oil and its related products, and natural gas. Price movements in these markets result from geopolitical developments, particularly in the Middle East, as well as weather patterns, and other economic fundamentals. Significant profits and losses, which have been experienced in the past, are expected to continue to be experienced in the future. Natural gas has exhibited volatility in prices resulting from weather pattern and supply and demand factors and will likely continue in this choppy pattern.
Metals. At December 31, 2007, the partnership had market exposure in the metals sector. The partnership's metals exposure was to fluctuations in the price of base metals, such as copper, aluminum, zinc, and nickel as well as precious metals, such as gold. Economic forces, supply and demand inequalities, geopolitical factors, and market expectations influence price movements in these markets. The trading advisor utilizes the trading system(s) to take positions when market opportunities develop, and the general partner anticipates that the trading advisor will continue to do so.
Morgan Stanley Charter WCM L.P.
The following were the primary trading risk exposures of Charter WCM at December 31, 2007, by market sector. It may be anticipated, however, that these market exposures will vary materially over time.
Currency. The second largest market exposure of the partnership at December 31, 2007, was to the currency sector. The partnership's currency exposure is to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily fluctuations which disrupt the historical pricing relationships between different currencies and currency pairs. Interest rate changes, as well as political and general economic conditions, influence these fluctuations. The partnership trades a large number of currencies, including cross-rates - i.e., positions between two currencies other than the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2007, the partnership's major exposures were to the euro, Japanese yen, and British pound currency crosses, as well as to outright U.S. dollar positions. Outright positions consist of the U.S. dollar vs. other currencies. These other currencies include major and minor currencies. The general partner does not anticipate that the risk associated with the partnership's currency trades will change significantly in the future.
Interest Rate. At December 31, 2007, the partnership had market exposure to the global interest rate sector. Exposure was primarily spread across the U.S., Japanese, European, Australian, and Canadian interest rate sectors. Interest rate movements directly affect the price of the sovereign bond futures positions held by the partnership and indirectly affect the value of its stock index and currency positions. Interest rate movements in one country, as well as relative interest rate movements between countries, materially impact the partnership's profitability. The partnership's interest rate exposure is generally to interest rate fluctuations in the U.S. and the other G-7 countries. However, the partnership also takes futures positions in the government debt of smaller nations — e.g., Australia. The general partner anticipates that the G-7 countries' and Australian interest rates will remain the primary interest rate exposure of the partnership for the foreseeable future. The speculative futures positions held by the partnership may range from short to long-term instruments. Consequently, changes in short, medium, or long-term interest rates may have an effect on the partnership.
Equity. At December 31, 2007, the partnership had market exposure to the global stock index sector, primarily to equity price risk in the G-7 countries. The stock index futures traded by the
