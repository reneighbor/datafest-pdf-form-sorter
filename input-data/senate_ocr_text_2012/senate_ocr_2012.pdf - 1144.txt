Section 5.2 Rights of Partners to Capital. No Partner will be entitled to interest on the Partner's Capital Contribution, nor will any Partner be entitled to the return of any capital of the Partnership except (a) upon the repurchase by the Partnership of the Partner's Units in accordance with Section 4.5 of this Agreement, (b) in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.5(b) of this Agreement or (c) upon the liquidation of the Partnership's assets in accordance with Section 6.2 of this Agreement.

Section 5.3 Capital Accounts. The Partnership shall maintain a separate Capital Account on its books for each Partner. As of any date, the Capital Account of a Partner shall be equal to the NAV per Unit as of such date, multiplied by the number of Units then held by such Partner. Any amounts charged or debited against a Partner's Capital Account under Sections 5.4 and 5.5, other than among all Partners in accordance with the number of Units held by each such Partner, shall be treated as a partial redemption of such Partner's Units for no additional consideration as of the date on which the Board of Directors determines such charge or debit is required to be made, and such Partner's Units shall be reduced thereby as appropriately determined by the Partnership. Any amounts credited to a Partner's Capital Account under Sections 5.4 and 5.5, other than among all Partners in accordance with the number of Units held by each such Partner, shall be treated as an issuance of additional Units to such Partner for no additional consideration as of the date on which the Board of Directors determines such credit is required to be made, and such Partner's Units shall be increased thereby as appropriately determined by the Partnership.
