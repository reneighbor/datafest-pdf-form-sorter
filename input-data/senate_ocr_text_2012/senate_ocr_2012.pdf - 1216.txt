African equity index futures as prices moved higher on continued strength in gold prices and optimism that the business climate in South Africa would continue to improve. In the metals markets, gains of approximately 3.3% were recorded from long futures positions in copper and zinc as prices trended higher throughout the year amid persistent demand from China. Additional gains were recorded, primarily during February, September, October, November, and December from long positions in gold futures as prices moved higher amid investors' concern for rising inflation and energy prices. Within the global interest rate futures markets, gains of approximately 1.3% were experienced during January and March from long positions in European bond futures as prices trended higher amid a steady stream of weak economic data from the major countries of the European Union. In May, further gains were recorded from long positions in European interest rate futures as prices increased early in the month as investors sought the safe-haven of fixed-income investments due to speculation that certain hedge funds may have experienced significant losses. Prices then continued to strengthen after European Central Bank representatives publicly rejected calls for increases in European interest rates and after French voters rejected the European Union constitution. During June, additional gains were recorded from long positions in European interest rate futures as prices trended higher throughout the month due to European Central Bank officials' decision to keep key interest rates unchanged. Within the energy markets, gains of approximately 1.2% were recorded during February and March from long futures positions in crude oil and its related products as prices trended higher amid news of increased demand from China, fears of terror attacks against production facilities in the Middle East, cold weather in the Northeastern U.S., and predictions from analysts at Goldman Sachs that oil prices could reach $105 a barrel. In June, gains were recorded from long positions as prices moved higher amid concerns that production facilities in Gulf of Mexico would be affected by a tropical storm and news of weak supply. During July, additional gains were recorded from long positions in crude oil and unleaded gasoline futures as prices surged during the first week of the month on possible supply disruptions from Hurricane Dennis. Prices continued to move higher towards the end of July after news of several refinery fires in Texas and Louisiana, declining U.S. inventories and passage by the U.S. Congress of President Bush's energy bill. Finally, in August further gains were recorded from long futures positions in crude oil and its related products and natural gas as prices climbed higher throughout the month on supply and demand concerns. After Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf of Mexico, prices advanced further to touch record highs. A portion of the partnership's overall gains for the year was offset by losses of approximately 3,6% in the currency markets, primarily during January, from short U.S. dollar positions relative to the euro, South African rand, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and Czech koruna as the value of the U.S. dollar reversed sharply higher in what many analysts described as a "corrective" move after its decline during the fourth quarter of 2004. This increase in the value of the U.S. dollar was attributed to data released by the U.S. Treasury Department which showed November's investment inflows to the U.S. were ample to cover that month's record trade deficit. Speculation that U.S. interest rates were likely to continue to rise, and fears that the re-valuation of the Chinese yuan was farther away than expected, also boosted the U.S. dollar. Further losses in the currency markets were incurred during March from long positions in the Polish zloty versus the U.S. dollar, as the value of the Polish currency moved lower. Additional losses were experienced from long positions in the South African rand, Singapore dollar, and euro relative to the U.S. dollar as the value of the U.S. dollar reversed sharply higher leading up to and after the U.S. Federal Reserve's announcement of a quarter-point increase in the federal funds rate. During May, long positions in the euro against the U.S. dollar resulted in losses as the value of the U.S. dollar increased after China downplayed rumors of a move toward a flexible exchange rate. Later in the month, weak economic data and geopolitical uncertainty due to French voters rejecting the European Union constitution resulted in the value of the euro weakening further.
