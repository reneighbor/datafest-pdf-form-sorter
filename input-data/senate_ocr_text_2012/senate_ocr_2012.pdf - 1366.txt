MORGAN STANLEY CHARTER SERIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization — Morgan Stanley Charter Campbell L.P. ("Charter Campbell"), Morgan Stanley Charter Aspect L.P. ("Charter Aspect"), Morgan Stanley Charter Graham L.P. ("Charter Graham"), and Morgan Stanley Charter WCM L.P. ("Charter WCM") (individually, a "Partnership", and collectively, the "Partnerships") are limited partnerships organized to engage primarily in the speculative trading of futures contracts, options on futures and forward contracts, and forward contracts on physical commodities and other commodity interests, including, but not limited to, foreign currencies, financial instruments, metals, energy, and agricultural products (collectively, "Futures Interests").
The Partnerships may buy or write put and call options through listed exchanges and the over-the-counter market. The buyer has the right to purchase (in the case of a call option) or sell (in the case of a put option) a specified quantity of a specific Futures Interest or underlying asset at a specified price prior to or on a specified expiration date. The writer of an option is exposed to the risk of loss if the market price of the underlying asset declines (in the case of a put option) or increases (in the case of a call option). The writer of an option can never profit by more than the premium paid by the buyer but can lose an unlimited amount.
Premiums received/paid from writing/purchasing options are recorded as liabilities/assets on the Statements of Financial Condition and are subsequently adjusted to current values. The difference between the current value of an option and the premium received/paid is treated as an unrealized gain or loss.
The general partner for each Partnership is Demeter Management Corporation ("Demeter"). The commodity brokers are Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("MS&Co.") and Morgan Stanley & Co. International pic ("MSIP"). MS&Co. acts as the counterparty on all trading of foreign currency forward contracts. For Charter Campbell, Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. ("MSCG") acts as the counterparty on all trading of options on foreign currency forward contracts. Demeter, MS&Co., MSIP, and MSCG are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley.
