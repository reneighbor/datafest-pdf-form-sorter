Limitations oh Value at Risk as an Assessment of Market Risk
VaR models permit estimation of a portfolio's aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating a range of varied market risks, reflect risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities, and can cover a wide range of portfolio assets. However, VaR risk measures should be viewed in light of the methodology's limitations, which include, but may not be limited to the following:
•	past changes in market risk factors will not always result in accurate predictions of the distributions and correlations of future market movements;
•	changes in portfolio value caused by market movements may differ from those of the VaR model;
•	VaR results reflect past market fluctuations applied to current trading positions while future risk depends on future positions;
•	VaR using a one-day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day; and
•	the historical market risk factor data used for VaR estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that could be incurred under certain unusual market movements.
In addition, the VaR tables above, as well as the past performance of each partnership, give no indication of each partnership's potential "risk of ruin".
The VaR tables provided present the results of each partnership's VaR for each of the partnership's market risk exposures on an aggregate basis at December 31, 2007 and 2006 and for the four quarter-end reporting periods during calendar year 2007. VaR is not necessarily representative of the historic risk, nor should it be used to predict a partnership's future financial performance or its ability to manage or monitor risk. There can be no assurance that a partnership's actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated above or that such losses will not occur more than once in 100 trading days.
Non-Trading Risk
Each partnership has non-trading market risk on its foreign cash balances. These balances and any market risk they may represent are immaterial.
Each partnership also maintains a substantial portion of its available assets in cash at Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated; as of December 31, 2007, such amounts were equal to approximately 88-98% of each partnership's net asset value. A decline in short-term interest rates would result in a decline in a partnership's cash management income. This cash flow risk is not considered to be material.
Materiality, as used throughout this section, is based on an assessment of reasonably possible market movements and any associated potential losses, taking into account the leverage, optionality, and multiplier features of a partnership's market sensitive instruments, in relation to the partnership's net assets.
Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Primary Trading Risk Exposures
The following qualitative disclosures regarding each partnership's market risk exposures — except for (A) those disclosures that are statements of historical fact and (B) the descriptions of how a partnership manages its primary market risk exposures — constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act Each partnership's primary market risk exposures, as well as the strategies used and to be used by the general partner and the trading advisors for managing such exposures, are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks, any one of which could
