value of the euro moved without consistent direction amid conflicting economic data out of Germany, Elsewhere in the currency markets, losses resulted from positions in the Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, South African rand, and Swiss franc relative to the U.S dollar, primarily during February and March. During August, further losses were incurred from long U.S. dollar positions against the euro, Swedish krona, and Swiss franc as the value of the U.S. dollar declined amid higher crude oil prices, lower durable goods orders data, the U.S. trade imbalance, and economic warnings from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. Smaller losses in August were experienced from long positions in the euro versus the British pound cross-rate as the value of the pound reversed higher against the euro. During September, losses were incurred from short U.S. dollar positions against the euro, Swiss franc, and Swedish krona as the value of the U.S. dollar increased on expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would most likely continue to raise interest rates, Additional losses of approximately 4.8% were recorded in the global interest rate futures markets during March from short European interest rate futures positions as prices reversed higher amid strength in the euro towards the beginning of the month as investors feared that continued strength in the currency could restrict foreign exports. Prices were also pushed higher on the expectations that Europe would continue to maintain a low interest rate environment. Further losses were experienced during February from long positions in long-term U.S. interest rate futures as prices declined in response to strong global economic data and congressional testimony by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, which supported Wall Street expectations for additional interest rate hikes. During the third quarter, losses were recorded from both long and short positions in U.S., Australian, and European fixed-income futures as prices moved without consistent direction amid conflicting economic data, uncertainty regarding the future interest rate policy of the U.S. and the European Union, and volatility in energy prices. A portion of these losses for the year was offset by gains of approximately 4.0% in the global stock index futures markets during May, June, July, September, and November from long positions in European equity index futures as prices moved higher on strength in the technology sector, strong corporate earnings; and weakness in the euro. Elsewhere in the global equity indices, gains were recorded during the fourth quarter from long positions in Japanese stock index futures as prices moved higher on a reduction in energy prices and general investor optimism about the future of the Japanese economy. Additional gains of approximately 3.4% were experienced in the energy markets during August from long futures positions in natural gas as prices climbed higher after Hurricane Katrina struck the U.S. Gulf Coast. Additional gains were experienced during September from long positions in natural gas as prices continued to strengthen in response to concern for the long-term effects on supplies in the Gulf of Mexico after Hurricane Katrina. Also pushing prices higher was anticipation of strong demand in the coming winter months and fears for the approach of Hurricane Rita and the additional damage it could have caused to output in the Gulf of Mexico. Within the metals markets, gains of approximately 1.5% were recorded during February, March, May, October, November, and December from long positions in copper, nickel, aluminum, and zinc futures as prices strengthened amid persistent demand from China. Within the agricultural complex, gains of approximately 0.9% were recorded during the fourth quarter from long positions in sugar futures as prices trended higher throughout the quarter in response to the European Union's refusal to amend its smaller than expected price reduction of sugar, favorable weather in global growing regions, and news that Brazil intended to use the majority of its sugar crop to produce ethanol.
