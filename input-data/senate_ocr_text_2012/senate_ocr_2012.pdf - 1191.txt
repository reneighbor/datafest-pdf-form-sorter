Trading Advisors
Each partnership pays its trading advisor a monthly management fee, whether or not the partnership is profitable. In addition, each partnership pays its trading advisor an incentive fee if trading profits are earned on the net assets.
Monthly management fee. Each partnership pays its trading advisor a monthly management fee equal to V12 of 2% (a 2% annual rate) of the partnership's net assets as of the first day of each month, whether or not the partnership is profitable. The monthly management fee compensates the trading advisor for the services performed in connection with the net assets under management.
Following is an example of the management fee payable by a partnership. If the net assets of Charter Graham equaled $100,000,000 as of the first day of each month during the fiscal year, the trading advisor would receive an aggregate monthly management fee for the year of $2,000,000 (V12 of 2% of $100,000,000 per month, or $166,667 times 12).
Incentive fee. Each partnership pays its trading advisor an incentive fee equal to 20% of trading profits experienced by the partnership as of the end of each calendar month. Trading profits means the net futures, forward, and options profits (realized and unrealized) earned on a partnership's net assets, decreased by monthly management fees and brokerage fees, with such trading profits and items of decrease determined from the end of the last period in which an incentive fee was earned by the trading advisor or, if no incentive fee has been earned previously by the trading advisor, from the date that the partnership commenced trading (or in the case of Charter WCM and Charter Aspect, from December 1, 2006, when the partnership began to receive trading advice from its new trading advisor) to the end of the period as of which the incentive fee calculation is being made. Extraordinary expenses of the partnership, if any, are not deducted in determining trading profits. An extraordinary expense would result from an event that is both unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence, such as litigation. No incentive fee is paid on interest earned by a partnership.
If incentive fees are paid to a trading advisor and the partnership fails to earn trading profits for any subsequent period, the trading advisor will retain the incentive fees previously paid. However, no subsequent incentive fees will be paid to the trading advisor until the partnership has again earned trading profits. If the partnership's net assets are reduced or increased because of redemptions or additions that occur at the end of or subsequent to an incentive period in which the trading advisor experiences a trading loss, the trading loss which must be recovered will be adjusted pro rata. In the case of each of Charter WCM and Charter Aspect, each partnership pays incentive fees based upon the performance of its new trading advisor beginning December 1, 2006, without regard to any losses incurred by the prior trading advisor.
Following is an example of the incentive fee payable by a partnership. If the trading advisor for Charter Graham earns trading profits of $1,000,000 for the period ended December 31, 2008, the trading advisor will receive an incentive fee of $200,000 for that period (20% of $1,000,000). If, however, the trading advisor experiences realized and/or unrealized trading losses, or fees offset trading profits, so as to result in a $250,000 loss for the period ended January 31, 2009, an incentive fee will not be paid to the trading advisor for that period. In order for the trading advisor to earn an incentive fee in the following period ending February 28, 2009, the trading advisor will have to earn trading profits exceeding $250,000 for that period since the incentive fee is payable based upon trading profits measured from the last period for which an incentive fee was paid (i.e., December 31), and not from the immediately preceding period. The foregoing example assumes no redemptions or additional purchases of units during the periods in question, which would require adjustments as described above.
