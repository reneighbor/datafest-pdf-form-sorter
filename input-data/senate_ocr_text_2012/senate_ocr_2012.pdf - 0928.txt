estimates only, subject to revision through the end of each Investment Fund's annual audit. Revisions to the gain and loss calculations will be an ongoing process, and no net capital appreciation or depreciation figure can be considered final until the annual audit of each Investment Fund is completed.
Conflicts of Interest. As a diversified global financial services firm, Morgan Stanley engages in a broad spectrum of activities including financial advisory services, asset management activities, sponsoring and managing private investment funds, engaging in broker-dealer transactions and other activities. In the ordinary course of business, Morgan Stanley engages in activities in which Morgan Stanley's interests or the interests of its clients may conflict with the interests of a Fund or investors. The potential for Morgan Stanley, as placement agent, to receive compensation in connection with a client's investment in a Fund presents such placement agent with a potential conflict of interest in recommending that such client purchase interests in a Fund. Such placement agent may in its sole discretion waive the placement fees payable by a client. You should take such payment arrangements into account where evaluating any recommendations relating to your investments.
Legal and Regulatory Risks. The regulation of the U.S. and non-U.S. securities and futures markets and Investment Funds has undergone substantial change in recent years and such change may continue. In particular, in light of the recent market turmoil there have been numerous proposals, including bills that have been introduced in the U.S. Congress, for substantial revisions to the regulation of financial institutions generally. Some of these bills introduced in Congress would require additional regulation of private fund managers, including requirements for such managers to register as investment advisers under Advisers Act and disclose various information to regulators about the positions, counterparties and other exposures of the private funds managed by such managers. The effect of regulatory change on the Investment Funds, while impossible to predict, could be substantial and adverse. In addition, the practice of short selling has been the subject of numerous temporary restrictions, and similar restrictions may be promulgated at any time. Such restrictions may adversely affect the returns of Investment Funds that utilize short selling.
Regulation as a Bank Holding Company. On September 21, 2008, Morgan Stanley obtained approval to become a bank holding company (a "BHC") under the BHCA upon the conversion of its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Morgan Stanley Bank, from a Utah industrial bank to a national bank. Concurrent with this conversion, Morgan Stanley became a "financial holding company" (a "FHC") under the BHCA, which is a status available to BHCs that meet certain criteria. FHCs may engage in a broader range of activities than BHCs that are not FHCs. However, the activities of FHCs and their affiliates remain subject to certain restrictions imposed by the BHCA and related regulations. Because Morgan Stanley is deemed to "control" the Funds within the meaning of the BHCA, these restrictions are expected to apply to the Funds as well.
Legislative Events. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, including Section 619 (the "Volcker Rule") which will, when effective, limit the extent to which a "banking entity," such as Morgan Stanley and its affiliates, may sponsor or invest in a hedge fund or private equity
