We seek to follow the Client Proxy Standard for each client. At times, this may result in split votes, for example when different clients have varying economic interests in the outcome of a particular voting matter (such as a case in which varied ownership interests in two companies involved in a merger result in different stakes in the outcome). We also may split votes at times based on differing views of portfolio managers.
We may abstain on matters for which disclosure is inadequate. We usually support routine management proposals except for certain "other business" and "meeting adjournment" proposals.
Votes on director nominees can involve balancing a variety of consideration, including those related to board and board committee independence, term length, whether nominees may be overcommitted, director attendance and diligence, director skills and the balance of expertise on the board, financial knowledge and experience, executive and director remuneration practices, and board responsiveness. We consider withholding support from or voting against a nominee if we believe a direct conflict exists between the interests of the nominee and the public shareholders, including failure to meet fiduciary standards of care and/or loyalty. We may oppose directors where we conclude that actions of directors are unlawful, unethical or negligent. We consider opposing individual board members or an entire slate if we believe the board is entrenched and/or dealing inadequately with performance problems; if we believe the board is acting with insufficient independence between the board and management; or if we believe the board has not been sufficiently forthcoming with information on key governance or other material matters.
We examine a range of issues—including proxy contests and proposals relating to mergers, acquisitions and other special corporate transactions—on a case-by-case basis in the interests of each fund or other account. We support substantial management/board discretion on capital structure, but within limits that take into consideration articulated uses of capital, existence of preemptive rights, and certain shareholder protections provided by market rules and practices. We are generally supportive of reasonable shareholder rights.
We vote on advisory votes on executive pay on a case-by-case basis. We generally support equity compensation plans if we view potential dilution/cost and burn rates as reasonable, and if plan provisions sufficiently protect shareholder interests. We also support appropriately structured bonus and employee stock purchase plans.
We consider social and environmental shareholder proposals on a case-by-case basis.
Process: The Proxy Review Committee (the "Committee") has overall responsibility for the Policy. Because proxy voting is an investment responsibility and impacts shareholder value, and because of their knowledge of companies and markets, portfolio managers and other members of investment staff play a key rote in proxy voting, although the Committee has final authority over proxy votes.
