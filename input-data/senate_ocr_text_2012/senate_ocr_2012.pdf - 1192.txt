commissions," which cover both the initial purchase (or sale) of a futures interest and the subsequent offsetting sale (or purchase). However, pursuant to the customer agreements with the commodity brokers, the partnerships pay a monthly flat-rate brokerage fee based on their net assets as of the first day of each month, at the rate of V12 of 6.00% (a 6.00% annual rate), irrespective of the number of trades executed on a partnership's behalf.
Following is an example of the brokerage fee payable by a partnership. If the net assets of a partnership equaled $100,000,000 as of the first day of each month during the fiscal year, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated would receive an aggregate monthly brokerage fee for the year of $6,000,000 (Viz of 6.00% of $100,000,000 per month, or $500,000 times 12).
From the flat-rate brokerage fees received from the partnerships, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated pays or reimburses the partnerships for all fees and costs charged or incurred by the commodity broker(s) for executing trades on behalf of the partnerships, including floor brokerage fees, exchange fees, clearinghouse fees, National Futures Association fees, "give up" fees, any taxes (other than income taxes), any third party clearing costs incurred by the clearing commodity broker(s), and costs associated with taking delivery of futures, forward, and options contracts.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated also pays, from the brokerage fees it receives, the ordinary administrative expenses of each partnership, and the continuing offering expenses of each partnership. Ordinary administrative expenses include legal, accounting and auditing expenses, printing and mailing expenses, and filing fees incurred in preparing reports, notices and tax information to limited partners and regulatory bodies. The continuing offering expenses of each partnership include legal, accounting and auditing fees, printing costs, filing fees, escrow fees, marketing costs, which include costs relating to sales seminars and the preparation of customer sales kits and brochures, and other related fees and expenses.
While each partnership pays a flat-rate brokerage fee, rather than "roundturn commissions" on each trade, it is estimated, based upon each trading advisor's historical trading, that such flat-rate brokerage fee would approximate roundturn commissions ranging as follows:
$40-$50 for Charter Graham $25-$35 for Charter WCM $45-$55 for Charter Aspect
You should note that the approximate roundturn commissions set forth above include administrative, offering, and other expenses, for which Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated is responsible, but which are typically paid separately from roundturn commissions. The foregoing estimates are based on past results and may vary in the future.
Financial Benefits. Each partnership deposits all of its assets with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated as commodity broker in connection with the partnership's futures, forward, and options trading. Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated then credits each partnership at each month-end with interest income on the partnership's funds on deposit with the commodity brokers. Amounts equal to the commodity brokers' margin requirements on the partnership's current futures, forward, and option contracts will be credited with interest income at a rate approximately equivalent to the rate the commodity brokers pay other similar customers on margin deposits. Partnership funds in excess of such current margin requirements but available to satisfy margin requirements will be credited with interest income at a rate equal to the monthly average of the 4-Week U.S. Treasury bill discount rate during such month.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, as permitted under CFTC regulations, may deposit the partnerships' funds which are held in segregated or secured accounts with banks or trust companies or invest such funds in CFTC specified securities and other instruments and retain any interest earned on those deposits or investments.
