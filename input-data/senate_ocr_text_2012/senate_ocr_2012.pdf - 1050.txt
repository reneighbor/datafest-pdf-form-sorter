Acquisitions sometimes fail because the U.S. government, European Union or some other governmental entity does not approve of aspects of a transaction due to anti-trust concerns, tax reasons, subsequent disagreements between the Acquiror or Target as to management transition or corporate governance matters or changing market conditions. Accordingly, the Investment Manager believes that key factors in the successful implementation of merger arbitrage are expertise in regulatory areas such as antitrust, tax, and general corporate law; corporate governance; fundamental analysis and valuation; the ability to assess the probability of a successful outcome; and the ability to access superior market intelligence.
The principal risk of Fixed Income Arbitrage is rising interest rates, which often result in a greater decline in the value of the "long" position than in the "short" position. In such a case, the Adviser will either have to provide additional collateral to the investment bank lender or close the position at a loss. There can be no assurance that any hedging techniques employed by an Adviser will be successful or that the hedging employed by the Adviser will not have the negative effect of lowering overall returns, or creating losses, in the portfolio or with respect to the applicable position.
Volatility Arbitrage often relies on extensive quantitative modeling, volatility estimation and proprietary in-house trading models. There can be no assurance that any hedging techniques employed by an Adviser will be successful or that the hedging employed by the Adviser will not have the negative effect of lowering overall returns, or creating losses, in the portfolio or with respect to the applicable position.
Statistical Arbitrage can involve large transaction costs because of the need to simultaneously buy and sell many different stocks and futures, and so leverage is often applied. In addition, sophisticated computer programs are typically needed to keep track of the large number of stocks and futures involved. While Statistical Arbitrage typically relies on quantitative, computer-driven models, some subjective investment decisions are required of the Adviser when selecting securities to be "long" and "short." The Investment Manager believes that the key requirement to profit in this strategy is strong fundamental company and industry analysis. An Adviser who is able to more clearly discern closely related pairs of securities will be more likely to outperform trading the strategy over time. There can be no assurance that any such hedging techniques will be successful or that the hedging employed by the Adviser will not have the negative effect of lowering overall returns, or creating losses, in the portfolio or with respect to the applicable position.
TACTICAL TRADING
The Global Macro/Managed Futures strategy involves positions in the cash, currency, futures and forward markets. Foreign currency transactions may involve, for example, the purchase of foreign currencies for U.S. dollars or the maintenance of short positions in foreign currencies. Foreign currency transactions may involve an Adviser Fund or Adviser Account agreeing to exchange an amount of a currency it does not currently own for another currency at a future date. An Adviser Fund or Adviser Account would typically engage in such a transaction in anticipation of a decline in the value of the currency it sells relative to the currency that the Adviser Fund or Adviser Account has contracted to receive in the exchange. An Adviser's success in these transactions will depend principally on its ability to predict accurately the future exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar.
PRIVATE INVESTMENTS
Securities issued by private partnerships investing in private equity, real estate, energy and natural resources and other investments may be more illiquid than securities issued by other Adviser Funds generally, because the partnerships' underlying investments may tend to be less liquid than other types of investments. The eventual success or failure of Private Equity investing ultimately hinges on the ability of Advisers to attract and develop a steady flow of quality investment opportunities to analyze.
Generally, little public information exists about privately held companies, and Advisers will be required to rely on the ability of their management teams to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential risks and returns involved in investing in these companies. These companies and their financial information will not be subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public companies. If the Advisers are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, they may not make a fully informed investment decision, and may lose money on these investments.
Substantially all of the securities of privately held companies will be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or will otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities. See the "RISKS OF SECURITIES ACTIVITIES OF THE ADVISERS -ILLIQUID PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS" in the Funds' S AI for a detailed discussion of risks of investing in illiquid securities.
Additionally, privately held companies frequently have less diverse product lines and smaller market presence than larger competitors. All of these factors could affect the Funds' investment returns.
