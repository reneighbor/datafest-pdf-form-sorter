the Offshore Fund. A discussion regarding the basis for the approval of the Board of Directors of each Fund (each, a "Board") of the Investment Management Agreement for the Master Fund is available in the Master Fund's annual report dated March 31, 2011.
The Investment Manager has contractually agreed to waive its Fund Servicing Fee and/or reimburse Other Expenses until July 31, 2012, so that the Total Annual Expenses (excluding taxes, interest, brokerage commissions, other transaction-related expenses, any extraordinary expenses of the Funds, any Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, as well as any performance allocation payable by the Funds or the Master Fund) for this period will not exceed 2.35% for the Funds (the "Expense Limitation"). The Funds will carry forward, for a period not to exceed (3) three years from the date on which a waiver or reimbursement is made by the Investment Manager, any expenses in excess of the Expense Limitation and repay the Investment Manager such amounts, provided the Funds are able to effect such reimbursement and remain in compliance with the Expense Limitation disclosed in the then effective Prospectus. The Funds' Expense Limitation Agreements are calculated based on end of month net asset values. However, in the financial statements for the Funds, the expense ratios presented in the financial highlights are calculated based on average monthly net assets.
SALES CHARGE, Investments in the Funds may be subject to a sales charge of up to 2.00% by the Distributor. The sales charge will be in addition to each investor's purchase amount, and will not constitute part of an investor's capital contribution to the Fund or part of the assets of a Fund. No sales charge or a reduced sales charge is expected to be charged with respect to investments by the Investment Manager and its affiliates, and their respective directors, principals, officers and employees and others in the Investment Manager's sole discretion. See "DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS - SALES CHARGE."
PERFORMANCE ALLOCATION, The General Partner of the Master Fund will be allocated a Performance Allocation that is equal to 10% of the excess of the new net profits of the partner interests in the Master Fund (calculated and accrued monthly and payable annually and calculated separately for the Core Alternatives Fund, the TEI Fund and each other fund that serves as a feeder fund to the Master Fund) over the yield-to-maturity of the 90 day U.S. Treasury Bill as reported by the Wall Street Journal for the last business day of the preceding calendar year of each Fund.
FUND SERVICING FEE. Each Fund intends to pay compensation to HIP for fund services in accordance with a fund servicing agreement between each Fund and HIP (in such capacity, the "Servicing Agent"). The Servicing Agent receives a monthly fund servicing fee ("Fund Servicing Fee") equal to 1/12th of 0.85% (0.85% on an annualized basis) of the aggregate value of each Fund's net assets as of the end of each month. The Fund Servicing Fee payable to the Servicing Agent will be borne pro-rata by all Partners of each corresponding Fund before giving effect to any repurchase of Units in a Fund effective as of that date and will decrease the net profits or increase the net profits or increase the net losses of the Fund that are credited to its Partners. The Servicing Agent may waive (to all investors on a pro rata basis) or pay to third parties all or a portion of any such fees in its sole discretion. The Servicing Agent may delegate some or all of its servicing responsibilities to one or more service providers. The Servicing Agent may delegate and any such service provider will provide customary services, including some or all of the following: (I) assisting in the maintenance of a Fund's records containing information relating to Partners; (2) providing the Funds with personnel to perform such executive, administrative and clerical services as are reasonably necessary to provide effective administration of a Fund and Partner services; (3) as agreed from time to time with the Board in accordance with Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act, making available the services, of appropriate compliance personnel and resources relating to compliance policies and procedures of the Funds; (4) assisting in the administration of meetings of the Board and its committees and the Partners; (5) assisting in administering subscriptions and tender offers, including assistance in the preparation of regulatory filings and the transmission of cash between Partners and a Fund, and the Funds and the Master Fund (or any successor thereto designated by a Fund); (6) assisting in arranging for, at the Funds' expense, the preparation of all required tax returns; (7) assisting in the periodic updating of the Funds' prospectus(es) and statement(s) of additional information, the preparation of proxy statements to Partners, and the preparation of reports filed with regulatory authorities; (8) providing information and assistance as requested in connection with the registration of the Funds' Units in accordance with state securities requirements; (9) providing assistance in connection with the preparation of the Funds' periodic financial statements and annual audit as reasonably requested by the Board or officers of the Funds or the Funds' independent accountants; and (10) supervising other aspects of the Funds' operations and providing other administrative services to the Funds.
ADMINISTRATION SERVICES. Each Fund will pay UMB Fund Services, Inc. (the "Administrator") a fixed monthly administration fee of $2,000 ($24,000 on an annualized basis) in addition to a regulatory administration fee, transfer agency fees and certain out of pocket expenses (collectively, the "Fund Administration Fee"). In addition, the Master Fund will pay the Administrator an administration fee of up to 0.075% on an annualized basis of the net assets of the Master Fund (prior to reduction for any Management Fee) (the "Master Fund Administration Fee", and together with the Fund Administration Fee, the "Administration Fees") calculated as of month-end. The Master Fund Administration Fee will be paid to the Administrator pro rata before giving effect to any repurchase of interests in the Master Fund effective as of that date, and will decrease the net profits or increase the net losses of the Master Fund that are credited to its partners. The Funds and the Master Fund will also reimburse the Administrator for certain out-of-pocket expenses and pay the Administrator a fee for transfer agency services.
