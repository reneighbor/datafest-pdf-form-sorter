their historical trading ranges. By continually monitoring these relationships, the Adviser can attempt to identify when the securities or asset classes trade out of their normal trading range and can put a trade on when there has not been a fundamental, or exogenous, change in the relationship. This strategy thus seeks to profit when overall market index volatility declines, reverting back to a more normal historical range. As an adjunct strategy, these same derivative instruments can be used to manage risk and enhance returns on investments made utilizing other strategies.
Statistical Arbitrage strategies seek to profit from offsetting long and short positions in stocks or groups of related stocks exhibiting pricing inefficiencies that are identified through the use of mathematical models. The strategy primarily seeks out these inefficiencies by comparing the historical statistical relationships between related pairs of securities (e.g., intra-industry or competitor companies). Once identified, the Adviser will establish both long and short positions and will often utilize leverage as the identified discrepancies are usually very slight in nature. A strong reliance on computer-driven analysis and relatively minute pricing inefficiencies are what typically separate this strategy from a more traditional long/short equity strategy. Though typically market neutral in nature, a Statistical Arbitrage portfolio's gross long and short positions may be significantly large and portfolio turnover can often be high.
In addition to identifying related pairs of securities, statistical arbitrageurs will also seek out inefficiencies in market index constructions. This index arbitrage strategy is designed to profit from temporary discrepancies between the prices of the stocks comprising an index and the price of a futures contract on that index. For example, by buying the 500 stocks comprising the S&P 500 Index and simultaneously selling an S&P 500 futures contract, an investor can profit when the futures contract is expensive relative to the underlying basket of stocks based on statistical analysis. Like all arbitrage opportunities, index arbitrage opportunities typically disappear once the opportunity becomes better-known and other investors act on it.
TACTICAL TRADING
• Global Macro/ Managed Futures
The Tactical Trading investment strategy is composed generally of Advisers who engage in directional trading strategies. Some of the Tactical Trading strategies incorporate equity assets as well as currencies, commodities and debt instruments. Commodity trading advisors ("CTAs") and managed futures managers are included in the Tactical Trading investment strategy. The Tactical Trading investment strategy will have a relatively low correlation to the equity markets.
Advisers utilizing the Global Macro/Managed Futures strategy typically seek to generate income and/or capital appreciation through a portfolio of investments focused on macro-economic opportunities across numerous markets and instruments. This strategy may include positions in the cash, currency, futures and forward markets. These Advisers employ such approaches as long/short strategies, warrant and option arbitrage, hedging strategies, inter- and intra-market equity spread trading, futures, options and currency trading, and emerging markets (debt and equity) and other special situation investing. Trading positions are generally held both long and/or short in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets. Global Macro/Managed Futures strategies are generally categorized as either discretionary or systematic in nature and may assume aggressive investment postures with respect to position concentrations, use of leverage, portfolio turnover, and the various investment instruments used. With a broader global scope, returns to the Global Macro/ Managed Futures strategy generally exhibit little to no correlation with the broader domestic equity and bond markets. Advisers that are CTAs are registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and generally actively trade futures and options on futures to manage portfolios.
PRIVATE INVESTMENT STRATEGY
PRIVATE INVESTMENTS
•	Private Equity
•	Private Real Estate
•	Private Energy and Natural Resources
Private Equity investing seeks to generate capital appreciation through investments in private companies in need of capital. The Private Equity strategy seeks to profit from, among other things, the inefficiencies inherent in these markets through valuation and due diligence analysis of available business opportunities. Over time, the Master Fund will attempt to invest in a group of Adviser Funds that vary widely: sector, size, stage (venture, mezzanine, etc.), duration, liquidity, and the extent to which the Advisers take an active role in managing and operating the business. Additionally, it is expected that Adviser Funds will engage in both direct investment and co-investment private equity deals. The Investment Manager believes that the key capabilities necessary to successfully structure private equity transactions include, among other things, comprehensive business operations analysis; competitive industry landscape analysis; legal, environmental and other contingent liability analysis; ability to gauge management skill and effectiveness; ability to align interests of company management and the Adviser Fund; and ability to ascertain the optimal financing vehicle and structure.
