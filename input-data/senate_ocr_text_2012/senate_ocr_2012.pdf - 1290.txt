partner (Section 734) and transfers of units, including transfers by reason of death (Section 743), provided that a partnership election has been made pursuant to Section 754. As a result of the complexities and added expense of the tax accounting required to implement such an election, the general partner does not presently intend to make such an election for any of the partnerships. Therefore, any benefits which might be available to the partners by reason of such an election will be foreclosed. In addition, Sections 734 and 743 of the Code provide for mandatory adjustments to the basis of partnership property if a partnership distributes property to a partner and the basis of the property would have been reduced by more than $250,000 had a Section 754 election been in effect, or a partner assigns or otherwise transfers (including by reason of death) all or part of its interest in a partnership at a time when the partnership's basis in its assets exceeds the fair market value of those assets by more than $250,000.
Tax Returns and Information. The partnerships will file their information returns using the accrual method of accounting. Within 75 days after the close of each partnership's taxable year, the partnership will furnish each limited partner, and any assignee of the units of any limited partner, copies of the partnership's Schedule K-l indicating the limited partner's distributive share of tax items and any additional information as is reasonably necessary to permit the limited partners to prepare their own federal and state tax returns.
Partnership's Taxable Year. Each partnership has the calendar year as its taxable year.
Unrelated Business Taxable Income of Employee Benefit Plan Limited Partners and Other Tax-Exempt Investors. Income allocated to a limited partner which is an employee benefit plan or other tax-exempt entity should not be subject to tax under Section 511 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provided that the units purchased by such plans and entities are not "debt-financed."
However, if a partnership were to purchase physical commodities with borrowed funds (whether upon delivery under a futures or forward contract or otherwise) and to sell those commodities at a gain, the gain would likely constitute unrelated business income. The partnerships are entitled to engage in such leveraged purchases of physical commodities. Tax exempt investors should see "Certain ERISA Considerations" above.
Tax Audits
All partners are required under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, to report all the partnership items on their own returns consistently with the treatment by a partnership, unless they file a statement with the Internal Revenue Service disclosing the inconsistencies. Adjustments in tax liability with respect to partnership items will be made at the partnership level. The general partner will represent each partnership during any audit and in any dispute with the Internal Revenue Service. Each limited partner will be informed by the general partner of the commencement of an audit of a partnership. In general, the general partner may enter into a settlement agreement with the Internal Revenue Service on behalf of, and binding upon, limited partners owning less than a 1% profits interest if the partnership has more than 100 partners. However, prior to settlement, such a limited partner may file a statement with the Internal Revenue Service stating that the general partner does not have the authority to settle on behalf of the limited partner. If the audit of a partnership results in an adjustment, all partners may be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties.
The period for assessing a deficiency against a partner in a partnership with respect to a partnership item is the later of three years after the partnership files its return or, if the name and address of the partner does not appear on the partnership return, one year after the Internal Revenue Service is furnished with the name and address of the partner. In addition, the general partner may consent on behalf of each partnership to the extension of the period for assessing a deficiency with respect to a partnership item.
