The Absolute Return investment strategy is defined herein as having a relatively low or negative correlation to the equity markets. In addition, certain strategies within the Absolute Return investment strategy may have less volatility through the use of arbitrage based strategies and hedging tools (e.g., "market" puts and calls, etc.).
Event Driven Arbitrage centers on investing in securities of companies facing a major corporate event. The goal is to identify securities with a favorable risk-reward ratio based on the probability that a particular event will occur. Such events include, but are not limited to, corporate events, such as restructurings, spin-offs and significant litigation (e.g., tobacco litigation). Opportunities in this area are created by the reluctance of traditional investors to assume the risk associated with certain corporate events.
The Convertible Arbitrage strategy typically involves the purchase of a convertible debt or preferred equity instrument (an instrument that is effectively a bond or has a fixed obligation of repayment with an embedded equity option, non-detachable warrants or an equity-linked or equity-indexed note) concurrent with the short sale of, or a short over-the-counter derivative position in, the common stock of the issuer of such debt instrument. Investment returns are driven by a combination of an attractive coupon or dividend yield, interest on the short position and the level of the underlying stock's volatility (which directly affects the option value of the security's conversion feature). The Investment Manager believes that some of the key capabilities necessary to successfully run a Convertible Arbitrage portfolio include, among other things: reviewing the convertible market for attractive investment opportunities, accurately modeling the conversion option value, and in-depth fundamental credit analysis in building and managing the Convertible Arbitrage portfolio.
The Master Fund may invest in one or more Advisers with exposure in the Convertible Arbitrage strategy to provide greater diversification across markets (U.S. and non-U.S. issues), sectors, credit ratings, and market capitalizations.
The Merger Arbitrage strategy involves taking short and long investment positions in the stock of acquiring and target companies upon the announcement of an acquisition offer. Acquisitions are typically paid for in stock, cash or a combination thereof. Therefore, when an acquisition is announced, the acquiring company ("Acquiror") will establish a price per share of the company being acquired ("Target") in cash (per share cash price), stock (a share ratio is established) or a combination thereof. Typically, the Target is traded for less than the price being paid (in either cash or stock) prior to the announcement. When the announcement is made, the Target's stock price will typically increase but still trade at a discount to the price being offering by the Acquiror. This discount - and the size of the discount - is principally a function of three factors: (1) the risk that the acquisition will close; (2) the time frame for closing (i.e., the time value of money); and (3) the amount of liquidity or capital being deployed by merger arbitrageurs and other investors. Accordingly, if a merger arbitrageur or investor believes that the risk of the acquisition not closing is not significant relative to the returns that can be generated by the "spread" between the current stock price of the Target and the price being offered by the Acquiror, the merger arbitrageur or investor will generally buy shares of the Target and "short" shares of the Acquiror in a stock-for-stock transaction. When the deal closes, the risk premium vanishes and the Adviser's profit is the spread.
Fixed Income Arbitrage is designed to identify and exploit anomalous (typically based on historical trading ranges) spreads in the prices of related securities. Such disparities, or spreads, are often created by imbalances in supply and demand of different types of issues (for example, agency securities relative to U.S. Treasury securities). A combination of macroeconomic analysis, political risk analysis, analysis of government policy and sophisticated financial modeling is oftentimes used to identify pricing anomalies. A typical arbitrage position consists of a long position in the higher yield, and therefore lower priced, security and a short position in the lower yield, higher priced security. For example, agencies of a similar duration of U.S. Treasury bills have over time established a relatively well defined trading range and carry a higher interest rate or yield. When agency securities trade at a discount to this range (e.g., when there is discussion about whether agencies should continue to receive a U.S. government guarantee), such agency securities will trade at a higher than normal discount to U.S. Treasury securities (reflected by a higher current yield in agency securities). Accordingly, in such a situation, an Adviser would typically buy the agency securities "long" and then "short" the U.S. Treasury securities. When the spread narrows or becomes more in line with historical norms, the Adviser generates a profit by closing its position. In general, these fixed income investments are structured with the expectation that they will be non-directional and independent of the absolute levels of interest rates. As interest rate exposure is typically "hedged out," these strategies generally exhibit little to no correlation to the broader equity and bond markets.
Fixed Income Arbitrage may also include buying fixed income or yield bearing instruments "long" with a higher coupon or yield and "shorting" a shorter duration instrument with a lower coupon. The Adviser typically makes a "spread" on the difference between the higher yielding "long" position and the lower yielding "short" position. Investment banks may allow an Adviser to use significant leverage in these positions (particularly if the instruments are investment grade corporate securities or government securities).
Volatility Arbitrage entails the use of derivative investments and can be used on both a stand-alone basis and as a hedging strategy in conjunction with other investment strategies. As a stand-alone strategy, exchange-traded domestic or global index options and/or options on futures contracts are used to exploit anomalies in the pricing of volatilities in related assets. There are several well-defined related securities and/or asset classes that Volatility Arbitrage Advisers typically follow to determine when they are out of
