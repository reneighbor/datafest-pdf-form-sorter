ACCESS. Many Adviser Funds are organized as limited partnerships that are not required to register under the 1940 Act because they do not publicly offer their securities and are restricted as to either the number of investors permitted to invest in such Adviser Funds or as to the qualifications of persons eligible to invest (determined with respect to the value of investment assets held by the managers of such investor) in such Adviser Funds. Many of these Adviser Funds will have greater investment flexibility than traditional investment funds (such as mutual funds and most other registered investment companies) as to the types of securities owned, the nature of performance-based compensation paid to Advisers, the types of trading strategies employed, and in many cases, the amount of leverage they may use.
An investment in a Fund enables investors to invest, through the Master Fund's investments, with Advisers whose services typically are not available to the general investing public, whose investment funds may be closed from time to time to new investors or who otherwise may place stringent restrictions on the number and type of persons whose money they will manage. An investment in a Fund also enables investors to invest with a cross-section of investment strategies without incurring the high minimum investment requirements that Advisers typically would impose on investors.
CAPITAL ALLOCATION DECISIONS. The Funds expect the Master Fund to allocate its assets broadly among various investment strategies, and to have target ranges for the allocation of capital among such investment strategies. However, the allocation ranges provide the latitude for the Investment Manager to allocate more or less capital to a particular investment strategy depending on the Investment Manager's belief about the opportunities for attractive risk-adjusted returns afforded by that investment strategy over a given investment time horizon. In making such allocation decisions, the Investment Manager will consider national and international economic and geopolitical conditions, the risks incident to the investment strategy and the return opportunities for such strategy (among other considerations) and gauge these factors versus the relative opportunities with other investment strategies and the need for a broad portfolio to reduce risk (as measured by volatility).
The Funds' investment objective is non-fundamental and may be changed by the Board without the approval of the Partners. Except as otherwise stated in this Prospectus or the Limited Partnership Agreement of a Fund, the investment policies, allocation ranges, strategies and restrictions of the Funds are not fundamental and may be changed by the Board without the approval of the Partners. The Funds' principal investment policies and strategies are discussed below.
INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
The Core Alternatives Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing substantially all of its assets in the Master Fund, which in turn will invest its assets in Adviser Funds managed by Advisers, with the objective of adding additional Adviser Funds as the Master Fund's assets grow and the need to diversify among additional Adviser Funds increases. The TEI Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing substantially all of its assets in its corresponding Offshore Fund, which in turn will invest its assets in the Master Fund, which in turn will invest its assets in Adviser Funds managed by Advisers, with the objective of adding additional Adviser Funds as the Master Fund's assets grow and the need to diversify among additional Adviser Funds increases. The following is a description of each of the investment strategies within the hedge fund and private investment strategies in which the Advisers will invest:

OPPORTUNISTIC EQUITY
•	Long/Short Public Equity
•	Sector Specialist
The Opportunistic Equity investment strategy is generally composed of Adviser Funds that predominantly invest in all global markets, including the U.S. domestic markets, and predominantly invest in equity securities.

These Advisers will opportunistically allocate capital to those markets around the globe which they believe present the best opportunities for profit based on either the Adviser's fundamental company valuation analysis or perceived macroeconomic shifts. To achieve an appropriately broad range of investments, the Master Fund may employ more than one Opportunistic Equity Adviser, each J) of which will typically focus on particular geographical markets in a general set of market capitalization ranges and/or employ a 3 particular style of investing.
