(c)	As to the disposition of any action, suit, investigation or other proceeding (whether by a compromise payment, pursuant to a consent decree or otherwise) without an adjudication or a decision on the merits by a court, or by any other body before which the proceeding has been brought, that an indemnitee is liable to the Partnership or its Partners by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the indemnitee's office, indemnification will be provided in accordance with Section 3.8(a) of this Agreement if (1) approved as in the best interests of the Partnership by a majority of the Independent Directors (excluding any Director who is either seeking indemnification under this Agreement or is or has been a party to any other action, suit, investigation or proceeding involving claims similar to those involved in the action, suit, investigation or proceeding giving rise to a claim for indemnification under this Agreement) upon a determination, based upon a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), that the indemnitee acted in good faith and in the reasonable belief that the actions were in the best interests of the Partnership and that the indemnitee is not liable to the Partnership or its Partners by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the indemnitee's office, or (2) the Directors secure a written opinion of independent legal counsel, based upon a review of readily available facts (as opposed to a full trial-type inquiry), to the effect that indemnification would not protect the indemnitee against any liability to the Partnership or its Partners to which the indemnitee would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the indemnitee's office.
(d)	Any indemnification or advancement of expenses made in accordance with this Section 3.8 will not prevent the recovery from any indemnitee of any amount if the indemnitee subsequently is determined in a final judicial decision on the merits in any action, suit, investigation or proceeding involving the liability or expense that gave rise to the indemnification or advancement of expenses to be liable to the Partnership or its Partners by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of the indemnitee's office. In any suit brought by an indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification under this Section 3.8, it will be a defense that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct described in this Section 3.8. In any suit in the name of the Partnership to recover any indemnification or advancement of expenses made in accordance with this Section 3.8, the Partnership will be entitled to recover the expenses upon a final adjudication from which no further right of appeal may be taken. In any suit brought to enforce a right to indemnification or to recover any indemnification or advancement of expenses made in accordance with this Section 3.8, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to any indemnification or advancement of expenses, under this Section 3.8 will be on the Partnership (or any Partner acting derivatively or otherwise on behalf of the Partnership or its Partners).
(e)	An indemnitee may not satisfy any right of indemnification or advancement of expenses granted in this Section 3.8 or to which he, she or it may otherwise
