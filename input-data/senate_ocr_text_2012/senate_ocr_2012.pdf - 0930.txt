indefinite period of time in response to market turmoil or other adverse conditions (such as those experienced by many hedge funds during late 2008 into 2009). Investment Funds may also assess fees for redemptions or other withdrawals. The limited liquidity of these Investment Funds' interests may adversely affect a Fund were it to have to sell or redeem such interests at an inopportune time. A Fund may need to suspend or postpone repurchase offers if it is not able to dispose of its interests in Investment Funds in a timely manner.
Some of the Investment Funds may hold a portion of their assets in "side pockets" which are sub-accounts within the Investment Funds in which certain assets (which generally are illiquid and/or hard to value) are held and segregated from the Investment Fund's other assets until some type of realization event occurs. Side pockets thus have restricted liquidity, potentially extending over a much longer period than the typical liquidity an investment in the Investment Funds may provide. Should a Fund seek to liquidate its investment in an Investment Fund that maintains these side pockets, such Fund might not be able to fully liquidate its investment without delay, which could be considerable. In such cases, until a Fund is permitted to fully liquidate its interest in the Investment Fund, the value of its investment in such Investment Fund could fluctuate based on adjustments to the fair value of the side pocket as determined by the Investment Manager. In addition, if an Investment Fund establishes a side pocket prior to a Fund's investing in the Investment Fund, such Fund may not be exposed to the performance of the Investment Fund's assets held in the side pocket.
Use of Derivatives: Certain of our Funds, and some or all their respective Investment Funds, may invest in, or enter into, derivative or derivative transactions ("Derivatives"). Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their performance, at least in part, from the performance of any underlying asset, index or interest rate. Derivatives entered into by an Investment Fund can be volatile and involve various types and degrees of risk, depending upon the characteristics of a particular Derivative and the portfolio of the Fund or Investment Fund. If a Fund or an Investment Fund invests in Derivatives at an inopportune time or incorrectly judges market conditions, the investments may lower the return of the Fund or Investment Fund or result in a loss. A Fund or an Investment Fund also could experience losses if Derivatives are poorly correlated with its other investments, or if the Fund or Investment Fund is unable to liquidate the position because of an illiquid secondary market.
Highly Volatile Markets: The prices of commodities contracts and all Derivatives,-including futures and options, can be highly volatile. Investment Funds are subject to the risk that trading activity in securities in which the Investment Funds invest may be dramatically reduced or cease at any time, whether due to general market turmoil, problems experienced by a single issuer or a market sector or other factors. If trading in particular securities or classes of securities is impaired, it may be difficult for an Investment Fund to properly value any of its assets represented by such securities.
Leverage Utilized by Investment Funds: Investment Funds may utilize leverage in their investment activities. Specifically, some or all of the Investment Funds may make margin purchases of securities and, in connection with these purchases, borrow money from brokers and banks for investment purposes. Although leverage will increase investment
