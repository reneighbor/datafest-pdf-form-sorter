Notes to "Annual Returns of Various Asset Classes Over Time" Table:
For the analyses used in this table, the performance of independent indices has been used to represent the seven asset classes: U.S. stocks, U.S. Treasury bonds, U.S. corporate bonds, international stocks, global stocks, managed futures, and public managed futures funds. The respective indices used are the Standard and Poor's 500 Stock Index, the Lehman Brothers Treasury Bond Index, the Citigroup Corporate Bond Index, the Morgan Stanley Capital International ("MSCI") EAFE Index, the MSCI World Index, the Barclay CTA Index, and the CASAM CISDM Public CPO Asset Weighted Index.
The S&P 500 Stock Index and the Citigroup Corporate Bond Index are compiled assuming dividends and interest are re-invested.
The S&P 500 Index is based on a portfolio of 500 stocks (consisting of 17.64% Financials, 16.73% Information Technology, 12.86% Energy, 11.97% Health Care, 11.51% Industrials, 10.23% Consumer Staples, 8.48% Consumer Discretionary, 3.62% Telecommunication Services, 3.62% Utilities and 3.34% Materials). The weights of the stocks in the portfolio reflect the stocks' total market capitalization as of December 31, 2007. The S&P 500 Index accounts for approximately 75% coverage of U.S. equities as of December 31, 2007. Total return provides investors with a price-plus-gross cash dividend return. Gross cash dividends are applied on the ex-date of the dividend.
The Lehman Brothers Treasury Bond Index consists of all existing U.S. Treasury bond issues.
The Citigroup Corporate Bond Index is a benchmark of investment grade fixed rate corporate issues with maturities of at least one year and in minimum outstanding amounts of $100 million. The corporate issues encompass such industry sectors as Manufacturing, Service, Energy, Consumer, Transportation, Industrial-Other, Utility, and Finance,
The MSCI EAFE Index is comprised of approximately 1,000 companies, representing a market structure of 21 European and Pacific based countries covering 59 industries as of December 31, 2007. The index is used to represent international equities.
The MSCI World Index is comprised of more than 1,500 companies, representing a market structure of 23 countries around the world as of December 31, 2007. The index is used to represent global equities, including U.S. and Canadian markets.
The Barclay CTA Index provides a benchmark of performance of commodity trading advisors. In order to qualify for inclusion in the Barclay CTA Index, a commodity trading advisor must meet the following criteria: (1) the commodity trading advisor must have four years of prior performance history; and (2) in cases where a commodity trading advisor who is in the Barclay CTA Index introduces an additional program, this additional program is added to the Index only after its second year of trading. In 2008, there were 492 commodity trading advisor programs included in the calculation of the Barclay CTA Index. Monthly returns for the Barclay CTA Index reflect the composite fee structure of the representative commodity trading advisors, and therefore, may be higher or lower than those fees applicable to any one particular managed futures fund. Accordingly, the Barclay CTA Index is not representative of any specific Morgan Stanley managed futures fund.
The CASAM CISDM Public CPO Asset Weighted Index reflects the dollar-weighted performance of all public Commodity Pool Operators (CPOs) reporting to the CASAM CISDM Hedge Fund/CTA Database. In order to be included in the CPO Public Asset Weighted Index universe, a fund or pool must have at least $500,000 under management and at least a 12-month track record.
