Eligibility
To be eligible to receive a Wisconsin
Retirement System (WRS) retirement benefit, you
must meet all of the following six conditions:
1.	You must be vested* and at least age 55 (age 50 forpartici pants with some protective employment category service and certain participants who began covered Wisconsin teaching before May 11, 1973).
2.	You must terminate all employment covered by the WRS. Note: Part-time elected officials age 55 or older who have other WRS service may irrevocably waive that coverage if terminating all other covered WRS employment. If this applies to you, a Waiver of Part-Time Service (ET-4303) form is available from the Department of Employee Trust Funds (ETF) or at etf.wi.gov.
3.	You must remain terminated from all employment with a WRS employer that meets participation standards for at least 30 days after your termination date or the date the department receives your application, or on your benefit effective date, whichever is latest, if you return to the same WRS employer from which you retired, the 30-day requirement applies to all WRS employment regardless of whether it meets WRS participation standards.
4.	You must not be on a leave of absence or in temporary layoff status. You are considered an active employee if you are on an official leave of absence (limited to three years).
5.	You must submit a completed application to the ETF. Failure to complete certain vital portions of the form may result in your application being rejected as invalid and your subsequent application being treated as a new application
for purposes of receipt date. This could result in the loss of one or more months of benefits.
6. ETF must receive your completed application prior to your death. Retirement benefit applications received after your death are invalid.
If you terminate WRS employment due to a disability, you should contact ETF about eligibility for disability benefits before you apply for a retirement benefit. Taking a retirement benefit may affect eligibility for disability benefits.
Retirement Benefit Calculation Methods
WRS benefits are calculated under two separate methods:
•	The formula method; and
•	The money purchase method.
A formula monthly retirement benefit is computed by using:
•	Your final average monthly earnings,
•	Your years of creditable service,
•	The formula multiplier(s) for your service and employment categories, and
•	Any age reduction factor(s) based on your age at retirement.
A money purchase monthly retirement benefit is calculated by multiplying your total employee and matching employer balance (money purchase balance) plus interest by an actuarial factor based on your age when the annuity begins. Your money purchase balance is reported on your annual Statement of Benefits.
Vesting Requirement: If you began covered WRS employment after 1989 and your last termination date from covered WRS employment is before April 24, 1998, you must have some creditable service in at least five separate calendar years to qualify for a retirement benefit. If you do not meet this vesting requirement, you are only eligible for a separation benefit (a refund of your employee contributions plus interest) regardless of your age. You are automatically vested if you became covered under the WRS before 1990 or have covered WRS service on or after April 24, 1998. If the participant was not vested on the decree date used to divide a WRS account from a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, the alternate payee (former spouse) awarded a portion of the account is not vested.
