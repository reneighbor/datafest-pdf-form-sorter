within the specified period of time. Futures contracts and options on futures contracts are traded on U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges. A forward contract is an agreement directly between two parties to buy or sell a fixed amount of an underlying product at an agreed price at an agreed date in the future. Forward contracts are not traded on exchanges, but rather are traded in the dealer markets. A partnership may take long positions in futures, forward, and options contracts in which the partnership is obligated to take delivery of the underlying commodity, product, instrument, or index. A partnership also may take short positions in those contracts in which the partnership has an obligation to deliver the underlying commodity, product, instrument, or index. Futures, forward, and options contracts are traded in a number of commodities, products, instruments, and indices, including foreign currencies, financial instruments, precious and industrial metals, energy products, agricultural commodities, stock indices, and "soft" commodities like cotton and cocoa. For additional information on the futures, options, and forward markets, see "Statement of Additional Information" beginning on page 126.
In order to facilitate trading by the trading advisors, the general partner for the partnerships, in its sole discretion, may either invest a partnership's assets in an account managed by the trading advisor, or in interests in a separate trading company created by the general partner and advised by the trading advisor. It is anticipated that any such trading companies will take the form of limited liability companies for which the general partner will serve as trading manager and commodity pool operator (although they might also be created as limited partnerships or other types of entities). It is further anticipated that any such trading companies would fall under exemptions from delivering disclosure documents under CFTC Rule 4.21(a)(2), from preparing and delivering account statements under CFTC Rule 4.22(a)(4), and from having to prepare and deliver annual reports under CFTC Rule 4.22(c)(6). Other existing or future public and private commodity pools created by the general partner may invest in these trading companies. References to a partnership in this prospectus include any trading company in which the partnership has invested, unless the context otherwise requires. To the extent that a partnership invests in a trading company to access the trading of a trading advisor, the fees and expenses payable by the partnership, including management and incentive fees and brokerage fees, will remain the same as described in this prospectus, and the interest earned by the partnership on its assets will remain the same as described in this prospectus. As of the date of this prospectus, none of the partnerships has invested in a trading company.
The investment objective of each partnership is to achieve capital appreciation and to provide investors with the opportunity to diversify a portfolio of traditional investments consisting of stocks and bonds. While the partnerships have the same overall investment objective, and the trading advisors may trade in the same futures, forward, and options contracts, each trading advisor and its trading programs trades differently. Each partnership has a different trading advisor and trading program. You should review and compare the specifics of each partnership, its terms, and its trading advisor before selecting one or more partnerships in which to invest.
