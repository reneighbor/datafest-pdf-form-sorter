"Aggregate assets in program" in the aggregate amount of assets in the program specified as of February 29, 2008.
"Drawdown" means losses experienced by the trading program over a specified period, A small number of accounts in the portfolio composites have experienced monthly drawdowns and peak-to-valley drawdowns that are materially larger than the largest composite monthly drawdown and peak-to-valley drawdown. These variances result from factors such as small account size (i.e., accounts with net assets of loss than the prescribed portfolio minimum, which therefore trade fewer contracts than the standard portfolio), intra-month account opening or closing, significant intra-month additions or withdrawals, and investment restrictions imposed by the client.
"Worst monthly drawdown past five years" means greatest percentage decline in net asset value due to losses sustained by the trading program from the beginning to the end of a calendar month during the most recent five calendar years. .
"Worst peak-to-valley drawdown past five years" means greatest cumulative percentage decline in month-end net asset value of the trading program due to losses sustained by an account during a period in which the initial month-end net asset value of the trading program is not equaled or exceeded by a subsequent month-end net asset value of the program during the most recent five calendar years.
"Compound annual and year-to-date/period rate of return" presented in the composite performance capsules for the period October 1997 to December 2003 are calculated based on the "Fully-Funded Subset" method as prescribed by the CFTC. The rate of return is calculated by dividing the sum of net performance of the qualifying Fully-Funded Subset by the beginning net assets of the qualifying Fully-Funded Subset, except in periods of significant additions or withdrawals to the accounts in the qualifying Fully-Funded Subset. In such instances, the Fully-Funded Subset is adjusted to exclude accounts with significant additions or withdrawals that would materially distort the rate of return pursuant to the Fully-Funded Subset method. Subsequent to December 2003, period rate of return % is calculated by dividing net performance by nominal account size. Additions and withdrawals are accounted for in accordance with the modified OAT (Only Accounts Traded) method as described in NFA Rule 2-34. Returns are then compounded to arrive at the year-to-date rate of return.
Footnotes to Capsule B Pro Forma Performance Summary
Capsule B above reflects pro forma rates of return, which are the result of the general partner making certain pro forma adjustments to the past performance record of client accounts managed pursuant to the Winton Diversified Trading Program, the trading program to be employed by Winton for Charter WCM. The pro forma adjustments are an attempt to approximately reflect Charter Winton's brokerage, management and incentive fees and interest income, as opposed to the fees, expenses, interest income, applicable to the various accounts included in Capsule A above.
Capsule B must be read in conjunction with the description of Winton and its trading program above. Furthermore, you must be aware that pro forma rates of return have certain inherent limitations: pro forma adjustments are only an approximate means of modifying historical records to reflect certain aspects of the economic terms of Charter WCM, constitute no more than mathematical adjustments to actual performance numbers, and give no effect whatsoever to such factors as possible changes in trading approach that might have resulted from the different fee structure, interest income and other factors applicable to Charter WCM as compared to Winton's actual trading. The general partner believes that the method used above provides a fair representation of the pro forma effect of the different fees and interest income on the composite trading results.
