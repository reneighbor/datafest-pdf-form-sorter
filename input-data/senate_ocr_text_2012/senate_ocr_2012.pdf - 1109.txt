If any non-breaching Partner or the Partnership ("Initiating Non-Breaching Party") determines that any other Partner or any of that Partner's principals, Partners, members, directors, officers, employees or agents or any of the Partner's Affiliates, including any of the Affiliates' principals, Partners, members, directors, officers, employees or agents, should be enjoined from or required to take any action to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information, each of the other non-breaching Partners agrees to join the non-breaching Initiating Non-Breaching Party in pursuing injunctive relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
