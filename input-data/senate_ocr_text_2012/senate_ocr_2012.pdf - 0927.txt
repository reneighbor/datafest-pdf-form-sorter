Because a Fund may make additional investments in or redemptions from Investment Funds only at certain times according to limitations set out in the governing documents of each such fund, a Fund from time to time may have to invest some of its assets temporarily in money market securities or money market funds,, among other similar types of investments.
Investment Funds may permit or require that redemptions of interests be made in kind. Upon its redemption of all or a portion of its interest in an Investment Fund, a Fund may receive securities that are illiquid or difficult to value. In such a case, we would seek to cause the Fund to dispose of these securities in a manner that is in the best interest of the Fund.
