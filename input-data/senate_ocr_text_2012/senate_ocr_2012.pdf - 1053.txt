Under these procedures, Partners will have to decide whether to tender their Units for repurchase without the benefit of having current information regarding the value of the Units as of the Valuation Date. The Partner may inquire of a Fund, at the telephone number within this Prospectus, or the Administrator, at the telephone number accompanying an offer to purchase relating to a tender offer, as to the value of the Units last determined. In addition, there will be a substantial period of time between the date as of which the Partners must tender the Units and the date they can expect to receive payment for their Units from a Fund. However, promptly after the expiration of a repurchase offer, Partners whose Units are accepted for repurchase may be given non-interest bearing, non-transferable promissory notes by the Fund representing the Fund's obligation to pay for repurchased Units. Any such promissory notes will be held by the Administrator and can be provided upon request by calling UMB Fund Services at 1-888-844-3350. Payments for repurchased Units may be delayed under circumstances where the Master Fund has determined to redeem its interest in Adviser Funds to make such payments, but has experienced delays in receiving payments from the Adviser Funds.
Repurchases of Units by each Fund are subject to certain regulatory requirements imposed by SEC rules.
TRANSFERS OF UNITS
No person shall become a substituted Partner of a Fund without the consent of that Fund, which consent may be withheld in its sole discretion. Units held by Partners may be transferred only: (i) by operation of law; or (ii) under other extremely limited circumstances, with the consent of the Board (which may be withheld in its sole and absolute discretion and is expected to be granted, if at all, only under extenuating circumstances).
Unless counsel to a Fund confirms that the transfer will not cause the Fund to be treated as a "publicly traded partnership" taxable as a corporation, the Board generally will not consider consenting to a transfer of a Unit (or portion of a Unit) unless the transfer is: (i) one in which the tax basis of the Unit in the hands of the transferee is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to its tax basis in the hands of the transferring Partner (e.g., certain transfers to affiliates, gifts and contributions to family entities); (ii) to members of the transferring Partner's immediate family (siblings, spouse, parents, or children); or, with respect to the TEI Fund, (iii) a distribution from a tax-qualified retirement plan or an individual retirement account.
Notice to a Fund of any proposed transfer must include evidence satisfactory to the Board that the proposed transferee, at the time of transfer, meets any requirements imposed by the Fund with respect to investor eligibility and suitability. See "INVESTOR QUALIFICATIONS." Notice of a proposed transfer of a Unit must also be accompanied by a properly completed investor application in respect of the proposed transferee. In connection with any request to transfer a Unit (or portion of a Unit), a Fund may require the Partner requesting the transfer to obtain, at the Partner's expense, an opinion of counsel selected by the Fund as to such matters as the Fund may reasonably request. The Board generally will not consent to a transfer of a Unit by a Partner (i) unless such transfer is to a single transferee, or (ii) if, after the transfer of the Unit, the balance of the capital account of each of the transferee and transferor is less than $50,000. Each transferring Partner and transferee may be charged reasonable expenses, including, but not limited to, attorneys' and accountants' fees, incurred by the Fund in connection with the transfer.
Any transferee acquiring a Unit or a portion of a Unit by operation of law in connection with the death, bankruptcy, insolvency, adjudicated incompetence or dissolution of the Partner, will be entitied to the allocations and distributions allocable to the Unit or portion of the Unit so acquired, to transfer the Unit or portion of the Unit in accordance with the terms of the applicable Limited Partnership Agreement and to tender the Unit or portion of the Unit for repurchase by a Fund, but will not be entitled to the other rights of a Partner unless and until the transferee becomes a substituted Partner as specified in that Fund's Limited Partnership Agreement. If a Partner transfers a Unit with the approval of the Board, each Fund shall as promptly as practicable take all necessary actions so that each transferee or successor to whom the Unit is transferred is admitted to the Fund as a Partner.
By subscribing for a Unit, each Partner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless a Fund, its Board, the General Partner of the Fund, the Investment Manager, and each other Partner, and any affiliate of the foregoing against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including legal or other expenses incurred in investigating or defending against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses or any judgments, fines, and amounts paid in settlement), joint or several, to which such persons may f become subject by reason of or arising from any transfer made by that Partner in violation of the Limited Partnership Agreement or fc any misrepresentation made by that Partner in connection with any such transfer.
ftj	CAPITAL ACCOUNTS AND ALLOCATIONS
ffl	Capital Accounts. Each Fund shall maintain a separate capital account on its books for each Partner. As of any date, the capital
m	account of a Partner shall be equal to the NAV per Unit as of such date, multiplied by the number of Units then held by such Partner.
q	Any amounts charged or debited against a Partner's capital account under a Fund's ability to allocate special items, and to accrue
