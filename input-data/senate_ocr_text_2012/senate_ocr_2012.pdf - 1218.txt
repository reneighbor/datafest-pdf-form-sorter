gains as prices increased during September amid persistently strong international demand and fears of a shortage in supply. A portion of the partnership's gains for the year was offset by a loss of approximately 1.3% within the global stock index sector, primarily during February and March, from long positions in European and U.S. equity index futures as prices reversed sharply lower after former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated the U.S. economy might be headed for a recession. In addition, prices moved lower after worries that tighter credit conditions in China and Japan might dampen global growth first sent Chinese stock markets plunging before the sell-off spread to other equity markets. Additional losses were recorded during July, August, November, and December from long positions in U.S. and European equity index futures as prices decreased on persistent concerns that a collapsing U.S. sub-prime mortgage market and declining U.S. real estate prices might pull the global economy into a recession. Smaller losses of approximately 1.2% were recorded within the metals sector, primarily during January and May, from long positions in aluminum, zinc, and copper futures as prices declined after the Chinese government announced that it might raise export taxes for base metals, as well as on speculation that rising production and inventories might create a global surplus. Additional losses were experienced during August from long futures positions in silver as prices moved lower amid strength in the value of the U.S. dollar. Finally, long positions in copper futures resulted in losses during November as prices reversed lower due to rising inventories and concerns that demand for base metals might continue to slow after the U.S. Federal Reserve trimmed its economic growth forecast for 2008.

2006 Results. The most significant trading gains of approximately 9.1% were recorded in the metals sector, primarily during the first and second quarters, from long positions in copper, nickel, aluminum, gold, and silver futures. During the first quarter, copper, aluminum, and nickel futures prices strengthened amid weak supplies, forecasts for continued buying by China, and acceleration in demand from Japan, Europe, and the U.S. Elsewhere in the metals markets, gains were recorded from long positions in silver and gold futures as prices moved higher on persistent demand from foreign central banks and worries regarding global inflation. In addition, silver prices were also boosted after news that that a silver-backed Exchange Traded Fund would launch. During the second quarter, copper, nickel, and aluminum futures prices continued to move higher on strong global industrial demand from the U.S., China, and India while gold and silver futures prices both rallied to 25-year highs in April, benefiting from strong demand and lagging supply. Additional trading gains of approximately 3.7% were recorded in the global interest rate futures markets, primarily during the first half of the year, from short positions in U.S. and European interest rate futures as prices moved lower during March and April amid strength in regional equity markets and investor sentiment that interest rates in the United States and the European Union would rise in order to combat inflation. Smaller gains were experienced in August from long positions in Japanese and U.S. fixed-income futures as prices increased on higher demand amid concerns of a possible slowing of the global economy and news that Iran would continue its nuclear research program. In addition, Japanese fixed-income futures prices were pressured higher after lower than expected inflation data dampened expectations for another interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan. Within the agricultural complex, gains of approximately 0.7% were recorded primarily during January from long positions in sugar futures as prices trended higher, moving to their highest level since 1981, in response to a decline in inventories, as well as from increased ethanol demand. Additional gains were experienced in July and August, from short positions in sugar futures as prices were pressured lower following U.S. Department of Agriculture data showing that ethanol-production using sugarcane was more costly than previously expected, as well as from low
