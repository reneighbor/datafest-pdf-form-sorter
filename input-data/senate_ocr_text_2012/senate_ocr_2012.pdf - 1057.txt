Any suspension shall take effect at such time as the Board shall declare but not later than the close of business on the business day next following the declaration, and thereafter there shall be no determination of the NAV of the assets of the Master Fund until the Board shall declare the suspension at an end, except that such suspension shall terminate in any event on the first business day on which (a) the condition giving rise to the suspension shall have ceased to exist; and (b) no other condition under which suspension is authorized shall exist. Each declaration by the Board shall be consistent with such official rules and regulations (if any) relating to the subject matter thereof as shall have been promulgated by any authority having jurisdiction over the Master Fund and as shall be in effect at the time. To the extent not inconsistent with such official rules and regulations, the determination of the Board shall be conclusive. Whenever the Board declares a suspension of the determination of the NAV, then as soon as may be practicable after any such declaration, the Board will give notice to limited partners of the Master Fund, including each Fund, stating that such declaration has been made. At the end of any period of suspension as aforementioned, the Board will give notice to all limited partners of the Master Fund, including each Fund, stating that the period of suspension has ended.
TAXES
The following summary describes certain tax aspects of an investment in the Funds.
THIS SUMMARY IS NECESSARILY GENERAL AND EACH PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR IS ADVISED TO CONSULT WITH THE INVESTOR'S OWN TAX ADVISER WITH RESPECT TO THE FEDERAL, FOREIGN, STATE AND LOCAL TAX CONSEQUENCES OF PURCHASING AND HOLDING UNITS.
CLASSIFICATION OF THE FUNDS
THE FUNDS
Partnership Status. The Core Alternatives Fund, the TEI Fund and the Master Fund have previously received opinions from their former counsel that under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and the regulations under it, as in effect on the date of the opinion, as well as under the relevant authority interpreting the Code and the regulations, and based upon certain assumptions, each of the Funds will be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and not a corporation.
Under Section 7704 of the Code, a publicly traded partnership may be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, even though it would otherwise be classified as a partnership. A "publicly traded partnership" is any partnership die interests in which are traded on an established securities market or which are readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). Units in the Core Alternatives Fund, the TEI Fund and the Master Fund will not be traded on an established securities market. Tax counsel has provided the Funds with opinions to the effect that the interests in those Funds will not be readily tradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent of such a market) and, therefore, that each such Fund will not be treated as a "publicly traded partnership" taxable as a corporation. We believe that the relevant facts on which those opinions were based have not changed, so that the opinions continue to be applicable.
These opinions of counsel are not binding on the Service or the courts. If it were determined that a Fund should be taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes (as a result of, for example, a successful challenge to the opinions by the Service, changes in the Code or the Regulations or judicial interpretations of them, a material adverse change in facts,
or otherwise), the
taxable income of the Fund would be subject to corporate income tax. One consequence would be a significant reduction in the after-tax return to the Partners. The balance of the discussion below is based on the assumption that the Core Alternatives Fund, the TEI Fund and the Master Fund will be treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
As a partnership, a Fund will not be subject to federal income tax. Each such Fund will each file annual partnership information returns with the Service, reporting the results of operations. Each Partner will be required to report separately on his income tax return ^ his allocable share of the Core Alternatives Fund's or TEI Fund's, as the case may be, net long-term capital gain or loss, net short-... term capital gain or loss and ordinary income or loss, which, in the case of the Core Alternatives Fund, will, in turn, include that ^ Fund's allocable shares of those tax items of the Master Fund. Each Partner will be taxable on his allocable share of a Fund's taxable income and gain regardless whether he has received or will receive a distribution from the Fund.
fjjjy Delayed Schedule K-Is. It is unlikely that the Funds will be able to provide final Schedules K-l to Partners for any given year fig) until significantly after April 15 of the following year. The General Partner will endeavor to provide Partners with estimates of the »|J2) taxable income or loss allocated to their investment in the Funds on or before such date, but final Schedule K-ls will not be available until later than April 15. Partners will be required to obtain extensions of the filing date for their income tax returns at the federal, © state and local levels.
