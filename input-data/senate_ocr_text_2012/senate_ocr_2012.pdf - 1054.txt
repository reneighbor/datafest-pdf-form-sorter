Board determines such charge or debit is required to be made, and such Partner's Units shall be reduced thereby as appropriately determined by the Fund. Any amounts credited to a Partner's capital account under a Fund's ability to allocate special items and to accrue reserves, other than among all Partners in accordance with the number of Units held by each such Partner, shall be treated as an issuance of additional Units to such Partner for no additional consideration as of the date on which the Board determines such credit is
required to be made, and such Partner's Units shall be increased thereby as appropriately determined by the Fund.
p
Reserves. Appropriate reserves may be created, accrued, and charged against net assets and proportionately against the capital accounts of the Partners for contingent liabilities as of the date the contingent liabilities become known to a Fund or the Board. Reserves will, be in such amounts (subject to increase or reduction) that that Fund or the Board may deem necessary or appropriate. The amount of any reserve, or any increase or decrease therein, will be proportionately charged or credited, as appropriate, to the capital accounts of those investors who are Partners at the time when such reserve is created, increased or decreased, as the case may be; provided, however, that if any such reserve, or any increase or decrease therein, exceeds the lesser of $500,000 or 1% of the aggregate value of the capital accounts of all such Partners, the amount of such reserve, increase, or decrease shall instead be charged or credited to those investors who, as determined by the Board, were Partners at the time of the act or omission giving rise to the contingent liability for which the reserve was established, increased or decreased in proportion to their capital accounts at that time.
CALCULATION OF NET ASSET VALUE
GENERAL
The Funds, the Offshore Fund and the Master Fund calculate their respective NAV as of the close of business on the last business day of each Accounting Period (as defined below), as of each month-end, and at such other times as the Boards may determine, including in connection with repurchases of Units, in accordance with the procedures described below or as may be determined from time to time in accordance with policies established by the Boards. The NAV of the Core Alternatives Fund and the Master Fund will equal the value of the total assets of the Core Alternatives Fund and the Master Fund, respectively, less all of each entity's respective liabilities, including accrued fees and expenses. The NAV of the TEI Fund, Offshore Fund and the Master Fund will equal the value of the total assets of the TEI Fund, the Offshore Fund and the Master Fund, respectively, less all of each entity's respective liabilities, including accrued fees and expenses. The NAV of the Master Fund equals the value of the total assets of the Master Fund, less all of its liabilities, including accrued fees and expenses. In computing its NAV, the TEI Fund will value its interest in the Offshore Fund at the value of the Offshore Fund's interest in the Master Fund, and the Offshore Fund will value its interest in the Master Fund at the NAV provided by the Master Fund to the Offshore Fund. It is expected that the assets of the Funds will consist of their investment in the Master Fund. The NAV of the Master Fund depends on the value of the Adviser Funds, Adviser Accounts or other investments in which it invests.
The Investment Manager oversees the valuation of the Master Fund's investments, including its interests in the Adviser Funds, in accordance with written policies and procedures (the "Valuation Procedures") that the Boards and the Board of Directors of the Master Fund ("Master Fund Board") have approved for purposes of determining the fair value of securities held by the Master Fund, including the fair value of the Master Fund's investments in Adviser Funds. In accordance with the Valuation Procedures, fair value as of each month-end or as of the end of each Accounting Period, as applicable, ordinarily will be the value determined as of such date by each Adviser Fund in accordance with the Adviser Fund's valuation policies and reported at the time of the Master Fund's valuation. As a general matter, the fair value of the Master Fund's interest in an Adviser Fund will represent the amount that the Master Fund could reasonably expect to receive from the Adviser Fund if the Master Fund's interest was redeemed at the time of valuation (without regard to any early redemption fees or withdrawal fees that may be imposed by the Adviser Fund), based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that the Master Fund believes to be reliable. In the event that the Adviser Fund does not report a month-end value to the Master Fund on a timely basis, the Master Fund will determine the fair value of such Adviser Fund based on the most recent final or estimated value reported by the Adviser Fund, as well as any other relevant information available at the time the Master Fund values its portfolio. Using the nomenclature of the hedge fund industry, any values reported as "estimated" or "final" values are expected to reasonably reflect market values of securities when available or fair value as of the Master Fund's valuation date. A substantial amount of time may elapse between the occurrence of an event necessitating the pricing of Fund assets and the receipt of valuation information from the Adviser of an Adviser Fund.
Prior to the Master Fund investing in any Adviser Fund, the Investment Manager will conduct a due diligence review of the valuation methodologies utilized by the Adviser Fund, which as a general matter will utilize market values when available, and otherwise will utilize principles of fair value that the Investment Manager reasonably believes to be consistent, in all material respects, with those used by the Master Fund in valuing its own investments. Although the procedures approved by the Boards and the Master Fund Board provide that the Investment Manager will review the valuations provided by the Advisers to the Adviser Funds, none of the Master Fund Board, the Boards or the Investment Manager will be able to confirm independently the accuracy of valuations provided by such Advisers (which may be unaudited).
