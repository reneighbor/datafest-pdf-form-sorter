accounts or investing such funds, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated may choose to deposit the funds in non-interest bearing bank accounts at various banks, in exchange for which the banks offer Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated or its affiliates advantageous interest rates on loans up to the amount of the deposits. This is known as compensating balance treatment. The benefit to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and its affiliates from this compensating balance treatment is the difference between the lending rate they would have received without the deposits and the rate they receive by reason of the deposits. The benefit to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated from this compensating balance arrangement and the investment of the partnerships' funds will vary depending upon market conditions. As of the date of this prospectus, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and its affiliates have no compensating balance arrangements, but may in the future. The estimated benefit to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated for each partnership is set forth in the "Description of Charges — Charges To Each Partnership" table beginning on page 23. For more information regarding Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated's interest crediting arrangements with the partnerships and the deposit or investment of customer funds by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, see "Use of Proceeds—Interest Credits" beginning on page 28. Solely in the case of Charter Aspect, if any of that partnership's assets are invested in securities approved by the CFTC for investment of customer funds, the interest earned on such securities will be paid to that partnership.
Many of each partnership's foreign currency trades are executed in the over-the-counter foreign exchange markets, where there are no direct execution costs. Instead, each participant bank or dealer in these markets, including Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Morgan Stanley" Capital Group Inc., quotes a "spread" between the prices at which it is prepared to buy and sell a particular currency in a forward contract or a premium on an options contract, and such spread or premium is built into the pricing of the forward or options contract with a partnership. Only some of the partnerships' foreign currency forward trades are executed with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated; the rest are executed with dealers unaffiliated with Morgan Stanley. Where a trade is executed with an unaffiliated dealer, it would be "given-up" to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated or Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc., which then would act as the counterparty to the partnership on the foreign currency forward or options contract. The amount earned on a partnership's foreign currency forward trades and options on foreign currency forward trades with banks and dealers, including Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc., on the bid-ask spread is separate from the flat-rate brokerage fees paid by a partnership to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated as commodity broker. See "Conflicts of Interest" beginning on page 17.
Extraordinary Expenses
Each partnership is obligated to pay any extraordinary expenses it may incur. Extraordinary expenses will be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which generally include events that are both unusual in nature and occur infrequently, such as litigation.
Expense Limitations
The general partner may permit an increase, subject to state limits described below, in the management, incentive, and brokerage fees payable by a partnership only on the first business day following a redemption date. Limited partners do not have any right to vote with respect to the approval of any increase in the fees payable by a partnership. However, prior to any such increase, the following conditions must be satisfied:
•	notice of the increase must be mailed to investors at least five business days prior to the last date on which a "request for redemption" must be received by the general partner;
•	the notice must describe investors' redemption and voting rights; and
•	investors must not be subject to any redemption charges if they redeem units at the first redemption date following the notice.
