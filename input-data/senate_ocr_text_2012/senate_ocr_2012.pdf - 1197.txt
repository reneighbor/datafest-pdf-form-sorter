*	New investors and current limited partners of a Charter Series partnership are advised that effective May 1, 2006, the general partner no longer accepts any subscriptions for investments in Charter Campbell or any exchanges from other Charter Series partnerships for units of Charter Campbell. Current limited partners of Charter Campbell will continue to be able to redeem units of Charter Campbell and exchange units of Charter Campbell for units in other Charter Series partnerships at any month-end closing.
Each partnership calculates its net asset value per unit independently of the other partnerships. Each partnership's performance depends solely on the performance of its trading advisor.
With the exception of Charter Campbell, each partnership is continuously offering its units for sale at monthly closings held as of the last day of each month. The purchase price per unit is equal to 100% of the net asset value of a unit as of the date of the monthly closing at which the general partner accepts a subscription.
Following is a summary of information relating to the sale of units of each continuously-offered partnership through February 29, 2008:

Investment Objectives
The investment objective of each partnership is to achieve capital appreciation and to provide investors with the opportunity to diversify a portfolio of traditional investments consisting of stocks and bonds. While each partnership has the same over-all investment objective and the trading advisor for each partnership may trade in the same futures, forward, and options contracts, each trading advisor has developed its trading programs and trades futures, forwards, and options in a different manner. You should review and compare the specifics of each partnership, its terms, and its trading advisor before selecting one or more partnerships in which to invest.
