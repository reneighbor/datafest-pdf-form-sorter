2007 Results. The most significant trading gains of approximately 4.6% were recorded in the currency sector, primarily during January, April, and June from short positions in the U.S. dollar versus most of its major rivals, notably the euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Brazilian real, and New Zealand dollar, as the value of the U.S. dollax declined relative to these, currencies amid news that foreign central banks had diversified their currency holdings to non-U.S. dollar-denominated assets and fears that an economic slowdown in the United States would lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Meanwhile, the value of the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, and New Zealand dollar, also known as the "commodity currencies", moved higher in the wake of consistently rising commodity prices. During September and October, the value of the U.S. dollar continued to decline against the aforementioned currencies leading up to and after the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to reduce its benchmark interest rate to 4.5%, as well as on indications for further rate reductions in the near term, thereby resulting in further gains. Within the global interest rate sector, gains of approximately 4.0% were experienced, primarily during January, April, May, and June from short positions in British and U.S. interest rate futures as prices trended lower amid solid economic data, rising equity prices, and surging home prices in the United Kingdom and the United States, which reduced demand for the "safe haven" of fixed-income investments. Further gains were recorded during August and November from newly established long positions in U.S., British, and Japanese fixed-income futures as prices increased following a sharp decline in global equity markets and forecasts of deeper losses related to sub-prime investments, which fueled speculation that these respective Central Banks might need to reduce bon-owing costs in response to widespread fears of a global economic decline. Within the agricultural markets, gains of approximately 3.7% were recorded, primarily during May, June, August, September, and November from long futures positions in the soybean complex as prices increased amid persistent global demand and concerns that hot, dry weather in U.S. growing regions would reduce U.S. supplies. During November, futures prices of the soybean complex moved higher due to increased purchases from China, higher energy prices, and dwindling U.S. supplies. Further gains were experienced during December as prices continued to move higher amid speculation that the rising cost of oil might boost demand for alternative biofuels made from crops. Elsewhere, long positions in wheat futures resulted in gains as prices increased during September amid persistently strong international demand and fears of a shortage in supply. Within the energy markets, gains of approximately 2.4% were experienced during January from short futures positions in crude oil and its related products as prices declined on skepticism that OPEC would cut production as much as originally pledged. Additional gains were recorded during September, October, November, and December from newly established long futures positions in crude oil and its related products as prices trended higher due to persistent concerns that instability in Iraq and tension regarding Iran's nuclear program would negatively affect global supply. In addition, energy prices increased due to continued weakness in the value of the U.S.
