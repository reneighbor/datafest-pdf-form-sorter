Units may not be purchased with the assets of an ERISA Plan, an individual retirement account or Keogh plan if the general partner, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, any additional selling agents, any trading advisor, or any of their respective affiliates either:
•	has investment discretion with respect to the investment of such plan assets;
•	has authority or responsibility to give or regularly gives investment advice with respect to such plan assets for a fee and pursuant to an agreement or understanding that such advice will serve as a primary basis for investment decisions with respect to such plan assets and that such advice will be based on the particular investment needs of such plan; or
•	is an employer maintaining or contributing to such plan.
Subscribing for units does not create an ERISA Plan, individual retirement account or Keogh plan. If you are considering the purchase of units on behalf of an ERISA Plan, individual retirement account or Keogh plan, you must first ensure that such plan has been properly established in accordance with ERISA and/or the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations and administrative rulings thereunder, and that such plan has been adequately funded. Then, after all of the considerations discussed above have been taken into account, the trustee or custodian of such plan who decides to or is instructed to do so may subscribe for units in one or more of the partnerships, subject to the applicable minimum subscription requirement per partnership.
The offering of units to and acceptance of subscriptions on behalf of ERISA Plans, individual retirement accounts or Keogh plans is in no respect a representation by the general partner, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, any additional selling agents, any partnership or any trading advisor that the investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by plans generally or any particular plan.
MATERIAL FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS
Introduction
The general partner has been advised by counsel, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, that in its opinion, the following summary correctly describes the material federal income tax consequences to a U.S. taxpayer who invests in a partnership. The opinions appearing in this section are the opinions of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, except as otherwise specifically noted.

The federal income tax summary and the state and local income tax summary that follow, in general, relate only to the tax implications of an investment in the partnerships by individuals who are citizens or residents of the U.S. Except as indicated below or under "Certain ERISA Considerations," the summaries do not address the tax implications of an investment in the partnerships by corporations, partnerships, trusts, or other non-individuals. Moreover, the summaries are not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning, particularly since certain of the tax consequences of owning an interest in the partnerships may not be the same for all taxpayers, such as non-individuals or non-U.S. persons, or in light of an investor's personal investment circumstances. A complete discussion of all U.S. federal, state, and local tax aspects of an investment in each partnership is beyond the scope of the following summary, and prospective investors are urged to consult their own tax advisors on these matters.
