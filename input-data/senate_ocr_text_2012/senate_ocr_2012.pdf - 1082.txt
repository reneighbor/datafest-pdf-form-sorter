SECTION 3.4 Meetings of Partners, (a) Actions requiring the vote of the Partners may be taken at any duly constituted meeting of the Partners at which a quorum is present or by means of a written consent. Meetings of the Partners may be called by the General Partner, by the affirmative vote of a majority of Directors then in office, or by Partners holding at least a majority of the total number of votes eligible to be cast by all Partners, and may be held at any time, date and place determined by the General Partner in the case of meetings called by the General Partner or the Partners and at any time, date and place determined by the Directors in the case of meetings called by the Directors. In each case, the General Partner will provide notice of the meeting, stating the date, time and place of the meeting and the record date for the meeting, to each Partner entitled to vote at the meeting within a reasonable time prior to the meeting. Failure to receive notice of a meeting on the part of any Partner will not affect the validity of any act or proceeding of the meeting, so long as a quorum is present at the meeting.
