Item 6 - Performance-Based Fees and Side-By-Side Management
In the case of certain Accounts, the existence of a performance fee or allocation may create an incentive for us to make more speculative investments for the Account than we otherwise would make in the absence of such performance-based compensation. Any performance fee or allocation received by us or our affiliates will be in compliance with the requirements of Section 205 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"), and Rule 205-3 thereunder. In certain circumstances, the general partner of a Fund may defer or waive all or any part of the performance fee or allocation.
Conflicts of interest may arise where one or more Accounts are charged a performance fee or allocation and one or more Accounts are not. We have adopted allocation policies that prohibit our portfolio managers and investment committee members from taking into account performances fee issues when making investment allocation decisions among Accounts. The allocation procedures were designed to ensure that all investment allocation decisions are being made fairly and equitably among Accounts over time.

We generally provide investment advice to registered and unregistered investment companies, pooled investment vehicles, separate accounts, corporate/business entities and foreign government agencies. In addition, we provide hedge fund manager research services to our affiliate.
Investors who wish to participate in our Funds are generally required to invest a certain minimum amount, which ranges (depending on the Fund) from $50,000 to $100 million. Certain Funds may have minimum additional investment requirements. Certain Funds require that you must be, among other qualifications, a "qualified purchaser", as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").
The minimum account size for a separate account is negotiated on a case-by-case basis. Investors who wish to participate in Morgan Stanley AIP Hedge Fund Advisory's customized portfolio accounts are generally required to invest a minimum amount of $25 million.
