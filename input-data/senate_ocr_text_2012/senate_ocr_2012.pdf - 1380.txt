2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Income Taxes — Income taxes are provided for using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the temporary differences between the financial statement and the income tax basis of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse.
New Accounting Developments
In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Interpretation No, 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes—an interpretation of FASB Statement 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 became effective for Demeter as of January 1, 2007. Demeter is currently assessing the impact of the adoption on its financial statements.
