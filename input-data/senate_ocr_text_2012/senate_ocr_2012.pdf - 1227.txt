cause the actual results of each partnership's risk controls to differ materially from the objectives of such strategies. Government interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants, increased regulation, and many other factors could result in material losses, as well as in material changes to the risk exposures and the risk management strategies of each partnership. Investors must be prepared to lose all or substantially all of their investment in a partnership.
Morgan Stanley Charter Graham L.P.
The following were the primary trading risk exposures of Charter Graham at December 31, 2007, by market sector.Jt may be anticipated, however, that these market exposures will vary materially over time.
Currency. The largest market exposure of the partnership at December 31, 2007, was to the currency sector. The partnership's currency exposure is to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily fluctuations which disrupt the historical pricing relationships between different currencies and currency pairs. Interest rate changes, as well as political and general economic conditions, influence these fluctuations. The partnership trades a large number of currencies, including cross-rates — i.e., positions between two currencies other than the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2007, the partnership's major exposures were to the euro, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Polish zloty, British pound, and Swiss franc currency crosses, as well as to outright U.S. dollar positions. Outright positions consist of the U.S. dollar vs. other currencies. These other currencies include major and minor currencies. The general partner does not anticipate that the risk associated with the partnership's currency trades will change significantly in the future.
Equity. At December 31, 2007, the partnership had market exposure to the global stock index sector, primarily to equity price risk in the G-7 countries. The G-7 countries consist of France, the U.S., Britain, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Canada. The stock index futures traded by the partnership are by law limited to futures on broadly-based indices. At December 31, 2007, the partnership's primary market exposures were to the DAX (Germany), IBEX 35 (Spain), CAC 40 (France), Euro Stoxx 50 (Europe), NIKKEI 225 (Japan), FTSE 100 (United Kingdom), and Dow Jones (U.S.) stock indices. The partnership is typically exposed to the risk of adverse price trends or static markets in . the European, Japanese, and U.S. stock indices. Static markets would not cause major market changes, but would make it difficult for the partnership to avoid trendiess price movements, resulting in numerous small losses.
Interest Rate. At December 31, 2007, the partnership had market exposure to the global interest sector. Exposure was primarily spread across the European, Japanese, and U.S. interest rate sectors. Interest rate movements directly affect the price of the sovereign bond futures positions held by the partnership and indirectly affect the value of its stock index and currency positions. Interest rate movements in one country, as well as relative interest rate movements between countries, materially impact the partnership's profitability. The partnership's interest rate exposure is generally to interest rate fluctuations in the U.S. and the other G-7 countries. However, the partnership also takes futures positions in the government debt of smaller nations — e.g., Australia. The general partner anticipates that the G-7 countries' and Australian interest rates will remain the primary interest rate exposure of the partnership for the foreseeable future. The speculative futures positions held by the partnership may range from short to long-term instruments. Consequently, changes in short, medium, or long-term interest rates may have an effect on the partnership.
