MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Liquidity
Each partnership deposits its assets with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated as commodity broker in separate futures, forward, and options trading accounts established for the trading advisor. Such assets are used as margin to engage in trading and may be used as margin solely for a partnership's trading. The assets are held in either non-interest bearing bank accounts or in securities and instruments permitted by the CFTC for investment of customer segregated or secured funds. Since each partnership's sole purpose is to trade in futures, forwards, and options, it is expected that each partnership will continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes.
Each partnership's investment in futures, forwards, and options may, from time to time, be illiquid. Most U.S. futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as "daily price fluctuations limits" or "daily limits". Trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. If the price for a particular futures or options contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in that futures or options contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. These market conditions could prevent a partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or options contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions.
There is no limitation on daily price moves in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies. The markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid, which may prevent a partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent a partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets, subjecting it to substantial losses. Either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions. For the periods covered by this prospectus, illiquidity has not materially affected the partnership's assets.
There are no known material trends, demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the partnerships' liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.
Capital Resources
The partnerships do not have, nor do they expect to have, any capital assets. Redemptions, exchanges, and sales of units in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investments in futures, forwards, and options in subsequent periods, It is not possible to estimate the amount, and therefore the impact, of future inflows and outflows of units.
There are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, that would affect, nor any expected material changes to, the partnerships' capital resource arrangements at the present time.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations
The partnerships do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, nor do they have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments that would affect their liquidity or capital resources.
Results of Operations
General. Each partnership's results depend on the trading advisors and the ability of its trading advisor's trading programs to take advantage of price movements in the futures, forward, and options markets. The following presents a summary of each partnership's operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007, and a general discussion of each
