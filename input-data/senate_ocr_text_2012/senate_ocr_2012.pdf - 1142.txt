(j) Payments for accepted repurchases of Units of less than 95% of a Partner's Units generally will be paid approximately 90 days after the Valuation Date (after adjusting for fees, expenses, reserves or other allocations or repurchase) and will be subject to adjustment within 45 days after completion of the annual audit of the Partnership for the applicable Fiscal Year. Such annual audit may be delayed in the event that information necessary to complete the annual audit is not received on a timely basis from the Master Partnership or the Advisors. Payments for accepted repurchases of Units for 95% or more of a Partner's Units may be paid in two installments. Payment of an amount equal to at least 95% of the Units repurchased (after adjusting for fees, expenses, reserves or other allocations or repurchase) generally will be made approximately 90 days after the Valuation Date. Final settlement of payments in connection with the repurchased Units generally will be made within 45 days after completion of the annual audit of the Partnership for the applicable Fiscal Year. Payments in connection with repurchased Units may be delayed if such information is delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 4.5(j), the Directors, in their discretion, may cause the Partnership to pay all or any portion of the repurchase price in Securities (or any combination of Securities and cash) having a value, determined as of the date of repurchase, equal to the amount to be repurchased. All repurchases of Units will be subject to any and all conditions as the Directors may impose in their sole discretion. The General Partner may, in its discretion, cause the Partnership to repurchase all of a Limited Partner's Units, if the Limited Partner's Capital Account balance in the Partnership, as a result of repurchase or Transfer requests by the Limited Partner, is less than a minimum amount that may be established by the General Partner from time to time in its sole discretion. Subject to the procedures of this Section 4.5(j), the amount due to any Partner whose Units are repurchased will be equal to the value of the Partner's Capital Account or portion of such Capital Account, as of the applicable Valuation Date, after giving effect to all allocations to be made to the Partner's Capital Account as of that date. If all of a Limited Partner's Units are repurchased, that Limited Partner will cease to be a Limited Partner.
