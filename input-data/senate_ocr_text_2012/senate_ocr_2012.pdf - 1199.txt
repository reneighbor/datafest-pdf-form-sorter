for all futures, forwards, and options requiring as margin or premium for all outstanding positions more than 66 V3% of the partnership's net assets. Under certain market conditions, such as an abrupt increase in margins required by a commodity exchange or its clearinghouse or an inability to liquidate open positions because of daily price fluctuation limits, or both, the partnership may be required to commit as margin amounts in excess of the foregoing limit. In such event, the trading advisor will reduce its open positions to comply with the foregoing limit before initiating new positions.
3.	The partnership will trade currencies and other commodities in the interbank and forward contract markets only with banks, brokers, dealers, and other financial institutions which the general partner, in conjunction with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated as commodity broker, has determined to be creditworthy. In determining the creditworthiness of a counterparty to a forward contract, the general partner and the commodity broker will consult with the Corporate Credit Department of the commodity broker.
4.	The trading advisor will not generally take a position after the first notice day in any futures, forward, or options contract during the delivery month of that contract, except to match trades to close out a position on the interbank foreign currency or other forward markets or liquidate trades in a limit market.
5.	The partnership will not employ the trading technique commonly known as "pyramiding," in which the speculator uses unrealized profits on existing positions in a given futures, forward, or options contract due to favorable price movement as margin specifically to buy or sell additional positions in the same or a related contract. Taking into account the partnership's open trade equity on existing positions in determining generally whether to acquire additional futures, forward, and options positions on behalf of the partnership will not be considered to constitute "pyramiding."
6.	The partnership will not under any circumstances lend money to affiliates or otherwise. The partnership will not utilize borrowings except if the partnership purchases or takes delivery of commodities. If the partnership borrows money from the general partner or any affiliate thereof, the lender may not receive interest in excess of its interest costs, nor may the lender receive interest in excess of the amounts which would be charged the partnership (without reference to the general partner's financial abilities or guarantees) by unrelated banks on comparable loans for the same purpose, nor may the lender or any affiliate thereof receive any points or other financing charges or fees regardless of the amount. Use of lines of credit in connection with its forward trading does not, however, constitute borrowing for purposes of this trading limitation.
7.	The partnership will not permit "churning" of the partnership's assets.
8.	The partnership will not purchase, sell, or trade securities (except securities permitted by the CFTC for investment of customer funds). The partnership may, however, trade in futures contracts on securities and securities indices, options on such futures contracts, and other commodity options.
