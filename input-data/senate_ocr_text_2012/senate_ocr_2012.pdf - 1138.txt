require the Limited Partner requesting the Transfer to obtain, at the Limited Partner's expense, an opinion of counsel selected by the General Partner as to such matters as the General Partner may reasonably request. If a Limited Partner Transfers all of its Units, it will not cease to be a Limited Partner unless and until the transferee is admitted to the Partnership as a substituted Limited Partner in accordance with this Section 4.4(a).
(b) Each Limited Partner will indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership, the General Partner, the Directors, each other Limited Partner and any Affiliate of the Partnership, the General Partner (including, without limitation, Hatteras Investment Partners, LLC), the Director and each of the other Limited Partners against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including legal or other expenses incurred in investigating or defending against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses or any judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement), joint or several, to which these Persons may become subject by reason of or arising from (1) any Transfer made by the Limited Partner in violation of this Section 4.4(b) and (2) any misrepresentation by the Transferring Limited Partner or substituted Limited Partner in connection with the Transfer. A Limited Partner Transferring Units may be charged reasonable expenses, including attorneys' and accountants' fees, incurred by the Partnership in connection with the Transfer.
Section 4.5 Repurchase of Units.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, no Partner or other Person holding Units will have the right to withdraw or tender for repurchase any of its Units. The Directors may, from time to time, in their complete and exclusive discretion and on terms and conditions as they may determine, cause the Partnership to repurchase Units in accordance with written tenders. The Partnership will not offer, however, to repurchase Units on more than four occasions during any one Fiscal Year, unless the Partnership has been advised by its legal counsel that more frequent offers would not cause any adverse tax consequences to the Partnership or the Partners. In determining whether to cause the Partnership to repurchase Units, pursuant to written tenders, the Directors will consider the following factors, among others:
(1)	whether any Partners have requested to tender Units;
(2)	the liquidity of the Partnership's assets (including fees and costs associated with withdrawing from Advisor Funds);
(3)	the investment plans and working capital and reserve requirements of the Partnership;
