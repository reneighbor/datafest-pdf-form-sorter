interest rate increases. During June, long positions in the euro versus the U.S. dollar recorded losses as the U.S. dollar reversed higher against most of its rivals due to diplomatic developments made between the U.S. and Iran regarding Iran's nuclear research program, as well as news confirming the death of insurgent leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi in Iraq. Furthermore, the value of the U.S. dollar continued to move higher in the days leading up to the U.S. Federal Reserve's 17th consecutive interest rate hike on June 29. Additional losses were incurred during the first and second quarters from both short and long positions in the Mexican peso relative.to the U.S. dollar as the value of the peso moved without consistent direction amid political uncertainty in Mexico. Finally, in October, losses were experienced from long positions in the U.S. dollar versus the Swiss franc and the euro as the value of the U.S. dollar declined towards the latter half of the month after the U.S. Department of Commerce reported slower than expected growth in third quarter U.S. Gross Domestic Product, as well as a faster than expected decline in consumer core inflation.

Within the global interest rate sector, losses of approximately 1.3% were incurred largely from short positions in U.S. and Japanese fixed-income futures in August as prices increased on higher demand amid concerns of a slowing global economy and news that Iran would continue its nuclear research program. U.S. interest rate futures prices were also pressured higher by government reports showing a slow-down in the U.S. economy and soft inflation data, which boosted expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would hold interest rates steady. Further losses were incurred from long positions in Japanese fixed income futures during December as prices fell after the Tankan survey showed business confidence unexpectedly improved to a two-year high.

Prices then continued to move higher towards the end of March on concerns regarding the possibility of economic sanctions by the United Nations against Iran, one of the world's largest oil producers.
