• The trading advisors, commodity brokers, foreign currency forward and options counterparties and general partner may trade futures, forwards, and options for their own accounts, and thus they may compete with a partnership for positions. Also, the other commodity pools managed by the general partner and the trading advisors compete with the partnerships for positions. These conflicts can result in less favorable prices on the partnerships' transactions.
An investment in units may not diversify an overall portfolio. Because futures, forwards, and options have historically performed independently of traditional investments, the general partner believes that managed futures funds like the partnerships can diversify a portfolio of stocks and bonds. However, the general partner cannot assure you that any of the partnerships will perform with a significant degree of non-correlation to your other investments in the future. Information showing the monthly correlation comparison of each partnership to the S&P 500 Index and to the Citigroup Corporate Bond Index is provided on pages 136 to 139.
The partnerships are not registered investment companies. The partnerships are not required to register as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Accordingly, you will not have the protections afforded by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (which, among other matters, requires investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors and regulates the relationship between the adviser and the investment company).
Trading Advisor Risks
Reliance on the trading advisor to trade successfully. The trading advisor for each partnership is responsible for making all trading decisions for the partnership. The general partner cannot assure you that the trading program employed by a trading advisor will be successful.
Market factors may adversely influence the trading programs. Often, the most unprofitable market conditions for the partnerships are those in which prices "whipsaw," moving quickly upward, then reversing, then moving upward again, then reversing again. In these conditions, the trading advisors may establish positions based on incorrectly identifying both the brief upward or downward price movements as trends when in fact no trends sufficient to generate profits develop.
Single-advisor funds lack the diversity of multi-advisor funds. The partnerships are each managed by a single trading advisor. Therefore, the partnerships lack the potential benefit of trading advisor diversification available in funds that are managed by more than one trading advisor.
Increasing the assets managed by a trading advisor may adversely affect performance. The rates of return achieved by trading advisors may diminish as the assets under their management increase. This can occur for many reasons, including the inability of the trading advisor to execute larger position sizes at desired prices and because of the need to adjust the trading advisor's trading program to avoid exceeding speculative position limits. These are limits established by the CFTC and the exchanges on the number of speculative futures and options contracts in a commodity that one trader may own or control. You should know that the trading advisors have not agreed to limit the amount of additional assets that they will manage.
Charter Graham's use of an increased rate of leverage could affect performance. The general partner and the trading advisor for Charter Graham have agreed that the trading advisor will leverage the funds of Charter Graham at 1.5 times the leverage the trading advisor normally applies to its Global Diversified Program and its K4 Program. This increased leverage could, depending on the trading advisor's performance, result in increased gain or loss and trading volatility, as compared to other accounts employing the trading advisor's Global Diversified Program at standard leverage and K4 Program at standard leverage.
Limited partners will not be aware of changes to trading programs. Because of the proprietary nature of each trading advisor's trading programs, limited partners generally will not
