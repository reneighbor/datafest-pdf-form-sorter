provide a fuller description of the types of Investment Funds in which we cause an Account to invest. Our personnel use a wide range of resources to identify attractive Investment Funds and promising investment strategies for consideration in connection with investments by the Accounts. Our main sources of information include contacts with industry executives, established business relationships, and research materials prepared by others.
Fund of Hedge Funds: Our fund of hedge funds investment process consists of investing in hedge funds managed by Investment Managers who employ a variety of non-traditional liquid market investment strategies and certain investment funds managed in a traditional style. Liquid market investment strategies include a wide range of arbitrage (convertible bond, statistical, term structure, merger, mortgage backed security, global bond and capital structure), long-short equities and bonds, convergence, directional trading, distressed securities and options. These strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leverage or short-sale positions to take advantage of perceived inefficiencies across capital markets and are referred to as "alternative investment strategies". "Traditional" investment companies are characterized generally by long-only investments and limits on the use of leverage. Investment Funds following alternative investment strategies (whether hedged or not) are often described as "hedge funds". We may also seek to gain investment exposure, on behalf of an Account, to certain Investment Funds or to adjust market or risk exposure by, among other things, entering into derivative transactions such as total return swaps, options and futures. Our fund of hedge funds Accounts may also make Co-Investments as part of its investment strategy.
For certain Funds that employ a fund of hedge funds investment strategy we manage a portion of such Fund's assets in overlay strategies related to portable alpha applications of its alternative investments. Portable alpha is the process whereby alpha (defined as the return in excess of the risk-free rate) is transported onto a traditional asset class return (such as equities or fixed income) to enhance the return of the monies allocated to the underlying asset class without necessitating an alteration in the investor's asset allocation. For example, we may enter into a total return swap (with an external counterparty) on behalf of the Fund for the total return on the S&P 500 Index in exchange for payments of Libor + 50 basis points. The net return to the investor = (Fund of hedge funds return + S&P 500) - (Libor + 50 basis points).
Private Equity Fund of Funds: For our private equity funds of funds strategies, we implement our investment advice through three primary investment approaches: (a) primary commitments to Investment Funds; (b) Co-Investments, primarily alongside our existing primary Investment Fund managers; and (c) secondary market purchases of existing private equity Investment Funds. Our private equity fund of funds strategies may, in some cases, make investments in other than Investment Funds (both on a primary or secondary basis) or Co-Investments, such as illiquid private assets sourced from other alternative investment vehicles and/or publicly traded securities of private equity businesses or funds ("Other Investments").
