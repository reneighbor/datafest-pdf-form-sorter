CERTAIN ERISA CONSIDERATIONS
If you are a fiduciary with respect to a U.S. employee benefit plan or trust within the meaning of and subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") (any such plan, an "ERISA Plan") or an individual retirement account or a Keogh plan subject solely to the provisions of Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, you should consider, among other things, the matters described below before determining whether the purchase of units is appropriate. References to ERISA include parallel references to the Internal Revenue Code.
ERISA imposes certain general and specific responsibilities on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an ERISA Plan, including prudence, diversification, avoidance of prohibited transactions and compliance with other standards. In determining whether a particular investment is appropriate for an ERISA Plan, U.S. Department of Labor regulations provide that a fiduciary of an ERISA Plan must give appropriate consideration to, among other things, the role that the investment plays in the ERISA Plan's portfolio, taking into consideration whether the investment is designed reasonably to further the ERISA Plan's purposes, the risk and return factors of the potential investment, the portfolio's composition with regard to diversification, the liquidity and current return of the total portfolio relative to the anticipated cash flow needs of the ERISA Plan, the projected return of the total portfolio relative to the ERISA Plan's funding objectives, and the limitation on the rights of unitholders to redeem all or any part of their units or to transfer their units. Before purchasing units, a fiduciary should determine whether such an investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities and the foregoing regulations.
The Department of Labor has published a regulation, certain aspects of which have been modified by the recently enacted Pension Protection Act of 2006, describing when the underlying assets of an entity into which certain benefit plan investors (as defined in the Department of Labor regulation) invest constitute "plan assets" for purposes of ERISA. If the assets of an investing ERISA Plan, individual retirement account or Keogh plan were to be treated, for purposes of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of Title I of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code, as including an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets of a partnership, an investment in units would in general be an inappropriate investment for the ERISA Plan, individual retirement account or Keogh plan. The Department of Labor regulation provides that assets of an entity will not be deemed to constitute "plan assets" of a plan that purchases an equity security of the entity, if the equity security is a "publicly-offered security." A "publicly-offered security" is one that is:
•	freely transferable;
•	held by more than 100 investors independent of the issuer and of each other; and
•	either registered under Section 12(b) or Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or sold to the plan as part of a public offering of such securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, where the security is then timely registered under Section 12(b) or Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The units currently meet, and it is expected that the units will continue to meet, the "publicly-offered security" criteria of the Department of Labor regulation.
The general partner believes, based upon the advice of its legal counsel, that income earned by the partnership will not constitute "unrelated business taxable income" under Section 512 of the Internal Revenue Code to ERISA Plans, individual retirement accounts, Keogh plans and other tax-exempt entities. Although the Internal Revenue Service has issued favorable private letter rulings to taxpayers in somewhat similar circumstances, other taxpayers may not use or cite such rulings as precedent. If you have investment discretion on behalf of an ERISA Plan, an individual retirement account or a Keogh plan, you should consult a professional tax adviser regarding the application of the foregoing matters to the purchase of units.
