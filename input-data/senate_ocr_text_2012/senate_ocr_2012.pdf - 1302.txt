Financial Solutions, LLC, Memphis, TN. The MSCI World Index performance data for global stocks are provided by Morgan Stanley Capital International Inc., New York, NY. The Lehman Brothers Treasury Bond Index and the Barclay CTA Index performance data for U.S. Treasury bonds and managed futures, respectively, are provided by the Barclay Hedge Ltd., Fairfield, IA. The CASAM CISDM Public CPO Asset Weighted Index performance data for managed futures is provided by the Center for International Securities and Derivatives Markets, Isenberg School of Management, the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA. Performance of any of these indices (which, by definition, are averages of many individual investments) may not be representative of any specific investment within that index's asset class.
Indexes are unmanaged and returns are shown for illustrative purposes only. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Generally, an aggressive investment that seeks the highest possible gains will have a greater degree of risk, whereas a conservative investment that offers safety of principal tends to provide lower returns over time. Keep in mind that while all investing involves risk, stocks tend to experience greater volatility and carry greater risks than bonds. The income and principal payments of U.S. government bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Other investments are not insured, and your proceeds from the resale of stocks, from the resale, early redemption, or repayment at maturity of bonds, or from the redemption of interests in a managed futures fund, may be more or less than what you originally paid for them. International investing may subject the portfolio to additional risks including currency, political, economic, and market risks.
Managed futures investments are speculative, involve a high degree of risk, use significant leverage, have substantial charges, are generally less liquid than the other investments represented by the indices herein, and are suitable only for the risk capital portion of an investor's portfolio.
The managed futures data discussed reflect the fee structures of trading advisors managing individual accounts and do not reflect fee structures of commodity pools, which are typically higher. The comparison of the S&P 500 Index and the Barclay CTA Index is for illustrative purposes only. The Barclay CTA Index attempts to provide a benchmark of representative performance of the money managers within the managed futures industry. As of 2008, the Barclay CTA Index is comprised of over 492 money managers, all of which have at least four years of prior performance history. The Barclay CTA Index is unweighted and rebalanced at the beginning of each year. Accordingly, the Barclay CTA Index is not a proxy for, or otherwise representative of, any specific Morgan Stanley managed futures fund.
Furthermore, the S&P 500 Index and the Barclay CTA Index reflect the volatility and risk of loss characteristics of a broadly diversified equity portfolio and universe of commodity trading advisors, respectively. The performance results of any Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated managed futures fund will be different from the performance of the Barclay CTA Index.
The futures and forward markets are fundamentally different from the securities markets in that for every gain in futures and forward trading, there is an equal and offsetting loss. If a managed futures fund does not perform in a manner non-correlated with the general financial markets or does not perform successfully, investors will obtain no diversification benefits by investing in such fund.
