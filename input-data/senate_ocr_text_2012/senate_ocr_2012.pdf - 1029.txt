An investment in a Fund involves substantial risks, including the risk that the entire amount invested may be lost. The Core Alternatives Fund, through its investment in the Master Fund, and the TEI Fund, through its investment in the Master Fund through the Offshore Fund, primarily allocate their assets to Advisers and invest in Adviser Funds and Adviser Accounts that invest in and actively trade securities, commodities and other financial instruments using a variety of strategies and investment techniques that may involve significant risks. Various other types of risks are also associated with an investment in the Funds, including risks relating to the fund of funds structure of the Master Fund, risks relating to the master-feeder structure, risks relating to compensation arrangements and risks relating to the limited liquidity of the Units. Additional risks include:
•	Industry Concentration Risk
•	Non-Diversification Risk
•	Leverage Turnover
•	Valuation of Adviser Funds Highly Volatile Markets
•	Counter-Party Credit Risk
•	Dilution
Accordingly, the Funds should be considered speculative investments, and you should invest in the Funds only if you can sustain a complete loss of your investment. Past results of the Investment Manager or its principals, the Funds or the Advisers are not indicative of future results. See "RISK FACTORS."
