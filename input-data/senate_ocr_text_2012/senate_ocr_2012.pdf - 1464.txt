Re: Report to Senate Ethics Committee (Amendments to Dec 2011 filing)
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
Please find enclosed what I hope will be needed to fully respond to your requested information. Thanks to Mr. John Lewter for helping me to understand more clearly your requirements.
Enclosed is an amended page for Part IIIA as requested. I have added an account that was inadvertently excluded funded with proceeds from the sale of my old home. Also, please find enclosed copies of statements, with my home address redacted, of my modest financial holdings.
Single family home at 626 N. Edison St., Arlington, VA 22203 was bought 1986 and sold in April 2011. Thank you for your patience with my submission. It is not often one seeks public office and there is a learning
Cc: James E. Archie
