service that employs a matrix to determine valuations for normal institutional size trading units. The Boards will monitor periodically the reasonableness of valuations provided by any such pricing service. Debt securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less, absent unusual circumstances, will be valued at amortized cost, so long as such valuations are determined by the Boards to represent fair value.
Assets and liabilities initially expressed in foreign currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars using foreign exchange rates provided by a pricing service. Trading in foreign securities generally is completed, and the values of such securities are determined, prior to the close of securities markets in the United States. Foreign exchange rates are also determined prior to such close. On occasion, the values of securities and exchange rates may be affected by events occurring between the time as of which determination of such values or exchange rates are made and the time as of which the NAV of the Master Fund is determined. When such events materially affect the values of securities held by the Master Fund or its liabilities, such securities and liabilities may be valued at fair value as determined in good faith in accordance with procedures approved by the Boards.
In general, fair value represents a good faith approximation of the current value of an asset and will be used when there is no public market or possibly no market at all for the asset. The fair values of one or more assets may not be the prices at which those assets are ultimately sold.
Although the Valuation Procedures approved by the Boards and the Master Fund provide that the Investment Manager will review the valuations provided by the Administrator (via the Advisers or their administrators), neither the Investment Manager nor the Administrator will be able to confirm independently the accuracy of any unaudited valuations provided thereby.
Prospective investors should be aware that situations involving uncertainties as to the valuation of portfolio positions could have an adverse effect on a Fund's net assets if the judgments of the Boards and/or the Investment Manager (in reliance on the Adviser Funds and/or their administrators) regarding appropriate valuations should prove incorrect. The Master Fund may desire to dispose of an interest in an Adviser Fund, but be unable to dispose of such interest, and could therefore be obligated to continue to hold the interests for an extended period of time. In such a case, the Administrator, upon consultation with the Investment Manager, may continue to value the interests in accordance with the Valuation Procedures, without the benefit of the Adviser's or its administrator's valuations, and may, if so instructed by the Investment Manager, in its sole discretion, discount the value of the interests, if applicable, in accordance with the Valuation Procedures.
Each accounting period begins on the business day after the last business day of the preceding accounting period, and each accounting period (each, an "Accounting Period") ends on the first to occur of (1) the last business day of each fiscal year of the Fund; (2) the last business day of each taxable year of the Fund; (3) the business day preceding the effective date on which a contribution of capital is made to the Fund; (4) the Valuation Date with respect to any repurchase of a Unit or portion of a Unit by the Fund or the complete withdrawal by a Partner; (5) the business day preceding the business day on which a substituted Partner is admitted to the Fund; or (6) the effective date on which any amount is credited to or debited from the capital account of any Partner other than an amount to be credited to or debited from the capital accounts of all Partners in accordance with their respective Units. Partners will be sent the estimated monthly NAV free of charge upon request.
SUSPENSION OF CALCULATION OF NET ASSET VALUE
The Board, after consultation with the Investment Manager, may declare a suspension of the determination of NAV, subscriptions and redemption of interests in the Master Fund and payment on redemptions:
(a)	during any period when any of the principal stock exchanges or markets on which a substantial portion of the Master Fund's assets are quoted is closed other than for ordinary holidays, or during which dealings are substantially restricted or suspended;
(b)	during the existence of any state of political, economic, military or monetary affairs that constitutes an emergency, as determined by the SEC, and that renders the disposal of assets by the Master Fund reasonably impracticable;
(c)	during any breakdown in the means of communication normally employed in determining the price of any of the Master Fund's assets or the current price on any market or stock exchange on which prices for such assets are quoted;
(d)	during any period when remittance or transfer of monies that will or may be involved in the realization or payment of any of the Master Fund's assets is not reasonably practicable; or
(e)	during any period in which circumstances exist such that the Board reasonably deems it appropriate to suspend the calculation of NAV including, but not limited to, a request for a redemption that would seriously impair the Master Fund's ability to operate or jeopardize its tax status.
