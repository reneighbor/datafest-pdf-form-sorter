Directors then in office, which number may be greater, or lesser, than fourteen (14), but no fewer than the minimum number of directors permitted to corporations organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, except that no reduction in the number of Directors will serve to effect the removal of any Director. Each Partner approves-the delegation by the General Partner to the Directors, in accordance with Section 3.1 of this Agreement, of certain of the General Partner's rights and powers.
(b)	The term of office of each Director shall be from the time of such Director's election and qualification until his or her successor shall have been elected and shall have qualified, or until his or her status as a Director is terminated sooner in accordance with Section 2.11 (d) of this Agreement. Except to the extent the 1940 Act requires election by Limited Partners, if any vacancy in the position of a Director occurs, including by reason of an increase in the number of Directors as contemplated by Section 2,11 (a) of this Agreement, the remaining Directors may appoint an individual to serve in that capacity in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act. Independent Directors will at all times constitute at least a majority (or more if required by the 1940 Act) of the Directors then serving. An Independent Director will be replaced by another Independent Director selected and nominated by the remaining Independent Directors, or in a manner otherwise permissible under the 1940 Act.
(c)	If no Director remains, the General Partner will promptly call a meeting of the Partners, to be held within 60 days after the date on which the last Director ceased to act in that capacity, for the purpose of determining whether to continue the business of the Partnership and, if the business is to be continued, approving the appointment of the requisite number of Directors. If the Partners determine at the meeting not to continue the business of the Partnership, or if the approval of the appointment of the requisite number of Directors is not approved within 60 days after the date on which the last Director ceased to act in that capacity, then the Partnership will be dissolved in accordance with Section 6.1 of this Agreement and the assets of the Partnership will be liquidated and distributed in accordance with Section 6.2 of this Agreement.
(d)	The status of a Director will terminate (1) if the Director dies; (2) if the Director resigns as a Director; or (3) if the Director is removed in accordance with Section 2.11(e) of this Agreement.
(e)	Any Director may be removed with or without cause by a vote of a majority of the other Directors or by the vote or written consent of Limited Partners holding not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes eligible to be cast by all Limited Partners.
