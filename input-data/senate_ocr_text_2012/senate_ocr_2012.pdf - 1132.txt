The rights of indemnification provided under this Section 3.8 are not to be construed so as to provide for indemnification of an indemnitee for any liability (including liability under U.S. Federal securities laws which, under certain circumstances, impose liability even on Persons that act in good faith) to the extent (but only to the extent) that indemnification would be in violation of applicable law, but will be construed so as to effectuate the applicable provisions of this Section 3.8.
