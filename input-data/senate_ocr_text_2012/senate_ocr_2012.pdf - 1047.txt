determined at this time or until such instruments are developed or invested in by Adviser Funds or Adviser Accounts. Certain swaps, options and other derivative instruments may be subject to various types of risks, including market risk, liquidity risk, the risk of non-performance by the counterparty, including risks relating to the financial soundness and creditworthiness of the counterparty, legal risk and operations risk.
Derivatives may entail investment exposures that are greater than their cost would suggest, meaning that a small investment in derivatives could have a large potential impact on an Adviser Fund's or Adviser Account's performance.
If an Adviser Fund or Adviser Account invests in derivatives at inopportune times or judges market conditions incorrectly, such investments may lower the Adviser Fund's or Adviser Account's return or result in a loss. An Adviser Fund or Adviser Account also could experience losses if its derivatives were poorly correlated with its other investments, or if the Adviser Fund or Adviser Account were unable to liquidate its position because of an illiquid secondary market. The market for many derivatives is, or suddenly can become, illiquid. Changes in liquidity may result in significant, rapid and unpredictable changes in the prices for derivatives.
COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK. Many of the markets in which the Adviser Funds or Adviser Accounts effect their transactions are "over the counter" or "inter-dealer" markets. The participants in these markets are typically not subject to credit evaluation and regulatory oversight as are members of "exchange based" markets. To the extent an Adviser Fund or Adviser Account invests in swaps, derivative or synthetic instruments, or other over the counter transactions, on these markets, it is assuming a credit risk with regard to parties with whom it trades and may also bear the risk of settlement default. These risks may differ materially from those associated with transactions effected on an exchange, which generally are backed by clearing organization guarantees, daily marking to market and settlement, and segregation and minimum capital requirements applicable to intermediaries. Transactions entered into directly between two counterparties generally do not benefit from such protections. This exposes an Adviser Fund or Adviser Account to the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract (whether or not bona fide) or because of a credit or liquidity problem, thus causing the Adviser Fund or Adviser Account to suffer a loss. Such counterparty risk is accentuated in the case of contracts with longer maturities where events may intervene to prevent settlement, or where an Adviser Fund or Adviser Account has concentrated its transactions with a single or small group of counterparties. Adviser Funds and Adviser Accounts are not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their transactions with one counterparty. However, the Investment Manager, with the intent to diversify, intends to attempt to monitor counterparty credit exposure of Adviser Funds and Adviser Accounts. The ability of Adviser Funds and Adviser Accounts to transact business with any one or number of counterparties, the lack of any independent evaluation of such counterparties' financial capabilities and the absence of a regulated market to facilitate settlement may increase the potential for losses by a Fund.
INVESTMENT STRATEGY-SPECIFIC INVESTMENT-RELATED RISKS
In addition to the risks generally described in this Prospectus and the SAI, the following are some of the specific risks of each investment strategy:
OPPORTUNISTIC EQUITY
A short sale involves the theoretically unlimited risk of an increase in the market price of the security that would result in a theoretically unlimited loss. Short selling relies on, among other things, fundamental analysis, in-depth knowledge of accounting, an understanding of public market pricing and/or industry research. There can be no assurance that any hedging techniques employed by an Adviser will be successful or that the hedging employed by the Adviser will not have the negative effect of lowering overall returns, or creating losses, in the portfolio or with respect to the applicable position.
The main risk of investing in real estate, equity securities issued by real estate companies and in REITs is that the value of such investments might decline as a result of the performance of individual stocks, a decline in the stock market in general or a general decline in real estate markets. Other risks include: extended vacancies of properties, increased competition or overbuilding, increases in property taxes and operating expenses, changes in zoning laws, losses due to costs resulting from the clean-up of environmental problems, liability to third parties for damages resulting from environmental problems, casualty or condemnation losses, limitations on rents, changes in neighborhood values and the appeal of properties to tenants, and changes in interest rates. REITs prices also may drop because of the failure of borrowers to pay their loans, a dividend cut, a disruption to the real estate investment sales market, changes in federal or state taxation policies affecting REITs, and poor management.
Adviser Funds and Adviser Accounts may invest in securities of energy and natural resources companies, which means that their performances will be susceptible to the economic, business or other developments that affect those industries. For example, the value of such investments may be impacted by energy prices, supply and demand fluctuations, energy conservation, tax and other regulatory policies of governments, and global events including instability in the Middle East or war.
