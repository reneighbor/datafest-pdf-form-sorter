At any meeting of the limited partners, the following actions may be taken upon the affirmative vote of limited partners owning more than 50% of the units:
•	amend the limited partnership agreement;
•	dissolve the partnership;
•	remove and replace the general partner;
•	elect a new general partner or general partners if the general partner terminates or liquidates or elects to withdraw from the partnership, or becomes insolvent, bankrupt or is dissolved;
•	terminate any contract with the general partner or any of its affiliates on 60 days' prior written notice; and
•	approve the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the partnership.
Any of the foregoing actions may also be taken by limited partners without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote, by means of written consents signed by limited partners owning the required number of units. Notice of any actions taken by written consent must be given to non-consenting limited partners within seven business days.
Books and Records; Reports to Limited Partners
The books and records of each partnership are maintained at its principal office for at least five years. You or your authorized attorney or agent will have the right during normal business hours to inspect and copy the books and records of each partnership of which you are a limited partner. Alternatively, you may request that copies of the books and records be sent to you, provided that you pay all reasonable reproduction and distribution costs. The partnership will retain copies of subscription documentation in connection with purchases and exchanges of units for at least six years.
Within 30 days after the close of each calendar month, the general partner will distribute such financial and other information with respect to each partnership as the CFTC and National Futures Association require, together with information concerning any material change in the brokerage commissions or fees payable by the partnerships to any commodity broker. You will also receive within 90 days after the close of each fiscal year an annual report containing audited financial statements for the partnerships. Annual reports will provide a detailed statement of any transactions with the general partner or its affiliates and of fees, commissions, and any compensation paid or accrued to the general partner or its affiliates. By March 15 of each year, the partnership will send you the tax information necessary for you to prepare your federal income tax return. The net asset value of each partnership's units, which is estimated daily by the general partner, will be promptly supplied to you upon written request.
A written notice, including a description of limited partners' redemption and voting rights, will be mailed to the limited partners of a partnership within seven business days if any of the following events occur:
•	the net asset value of a unit decreases by at least 50% from the net asset value of that unit as of the end of the immediately preceding month;
•	the limited partnership agreement is materially amended;
•	there is any change in trading advisors or any material change in a management agreement;
•	there is any change in commodity brokers or any material change in the compensation arrangements with a commodity broker;
•	there is any change in general partners or any material change in the compensation arrangements with a general partner;
