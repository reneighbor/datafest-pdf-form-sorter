• there is any change in the partnership's fiscal year;
•	there is any material change in the partnership's trading policies as specified in the limited partnership agreement; or
•	the partnership ceases to trade futures, forwards, and options.
If you receive a notice as to a 50% decrease in net asset value per unit, that notice will also advise you that a "special redemption date".will take place when limited partners may redeem their units in the same manner as described under "Redemptions" beginning on page 97 for regular redemption dates. Further, following the close of business on the date of the 50% decrease giving rise to that notice, the partnership will liquidate all existing positions as promptly as reasonably practicable, and will suspend all futures, forward, and options trading through the special redemption date. The general partner will then determine whether to reinstitute futures, forward, and options trading or to terminate the partnership.
In addition, subject to limits imposed under certain state guidelines incorporated in the limited partnership agreements, no increase in any of the management, incentive, or brokerage fees payable by the partnerships, or any of the caps on fees, may take effect until the first business day following a redemption date. In the event of such an increase:
•	notice of the increase will be mailed to limited partners at least five business days prior to the last date on which a "request for redemption" must be received by the general partner with respect to the applicable redemption date;
•	the notice will describe the redemption and voting rights of limited partners; and
•	units redeemed at the first redemption date following the notice will not be subject to any redemption charges.
Each limited partner expressly agrees that in the event of his death, he waives on behalf of himself and his estate the furnishing of any inventory, accounting, or appraisal of the assets of the partnership and any right to an audit or examination of the books of the partnership.
The foregoing does not limit the ability of the estate of a deceased limited partner to inspect and copy the partnership's books and records, or obtain copies upon payment of reasonable reproduction and distribution costs, to the same extent as any limited partner in accordance with Section 8(e) of the limited partnership agreement.
