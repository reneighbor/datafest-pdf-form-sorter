The Offering of Units
The Charter Series Continuous Offering
Units of limited partnership interest of each continuously-offered partnership are being offered for sale at monthly closings held on the last day of each month. Since you must subscribe for units prior to the month-end closing date, you will not know the actual per unit purchase price until after the monthly closing has occurred. The purchase price of each unit in a partnership will be equal to 100% of the partnership's net asset value per unit as of the month-end closing date. The general partner calculates each partnership's net asset value per unit on a monthly basis by dividing the partnership's month-end net assets by the number of its month-end outstanding units. A partnership's net assets is its assets minus its liabilities.
Escrow Terms
During each partnership's continuous offering, your subscription will be transferred to, and held in escrow by, The Bank of New York, New York, New York. Subscription funds held in escrow will be invested in the escrow agent's money market account and will earn interest at the rate then paid by the bank on that money market account. If the general partner accepts your subscription, the escrow agent will pay the subscription amount to the appropriate partnerships and pay any interest earned on those funds to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, the selling agent for each partnership. In turn, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated will credit your customer account with the interest. If the general partner rejects a subscription, your account will be credited in an amount equal to the rejected subscription amount, together with any interest earned on those funds while held in escrow.
