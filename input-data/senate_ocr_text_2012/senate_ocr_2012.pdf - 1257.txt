Description of the Aspect Diversified Program
Aspect, will trade the assets of Charter Aspect pursuant to the Aspect Diversified Program. The Aspect Diversified Program is a broadly diversified global trading system that deploys multiple trading strategies that seek to identify and exploit directional moves in market behavior of a broad range of global financial instruments including (but not limited to) futures contracts in bonds, currencies, interest rates, equities, equity indices, debt securities and selected physical commodities. By maintaining comparatively small exposure to any individual market, the aim is to achieve real diversification.
The core objectives of the Aspect Diversified Program are to:
•	produce strong medium-term capital appreciation;
•	seek and exploit profit opportunities in both rising and falling markets using a disciplined quantitative and systematic investment process;
•	seek non-correlation with the broad bond and stock markets and thereby play a valuable role in enhancing the risk/return profile of traditional investment portfolios; and
•	minimize risk by operating in a diverse range of markets and sectors using a consistent investment process that adheres to pre-defined and monitored risk limits and determines market exposure in accordance with factors including (but not limited to) market correlation, volatility, liquidity and the cost of market access.
The investment approach that underpins the Aspect Diversified Program is proprietary. Aspect's investment philosophy has remained consistent and involves a scientific approach to investment driven by Aspect's belief that market behavior is not random but rather contains statistically measurable and predictable price movements and anomalies which, through sophisticated quantitative research and a disciplined approach, can be successfully identified and exploited for profit.
The Aspect Diversified Program employs a fully automated system to collect, process and analyze market data (including current and historical price data) and identify and exploit directional moves (or "trends") in market behavior, trading across a variety of frequencies to exploit trends over a range of timescales. Positions are taken according to the aggregate signal and are adjusted to control risk. The Aspect Diversified Program seeks to maintain positions in a variety of markets. Market concentration varies according to the strength of signals, volatility and liquidity, among other factors.
Allocation Methodology
Allocations to the strategy, markets and asset classes traded by the Aspect Diversified Program are reviewed on a regular basis using a robust and stable quantitative methodology which takes into account a range of factors that may include liquidity, risk and expected returns. The Aspect
