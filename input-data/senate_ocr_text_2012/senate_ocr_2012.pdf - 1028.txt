A prospective investor must submit a completed investor application on or prior to the acceptance date set by the Funds. Each Fund reserves the right to reject, in its sole discretion, any request to purchase Units in the Fund at any time. Each Fund also reserves the right to suspend or terminate offerings of Units at any time at the applicable Board's discretion. Additional information regarding the subscription process is set forth under "Investor Qualifications."
Investments in each Fund may be subject to a sales charge of up to 2.00% by Hatteras Capital Distributors, LLC (the "Distributor")- The Investment Manager may waive or reduce the sales charge for its professional staff (e.g., portfolio managers and traders) and others in its sole discretion. The full amount of sales charges may be reallowed by the Distributor to brokers or dealers participating in the offering. Your financial intermediary may impose additional charges when you purchase Units of a Fund.
Fund Servicing Fee	Each Fund will pay Hatteras Investment Partners, LLC (in such capacity, the "Servicing
Agent") for fund servicing in accordance with a fund servicing agreement. The Servicing Agent receives a monthly fund servicing fee ("Fund Servicing Fee") equal to 1712th of 0.85% (0.85% on an annualized basis) of the aggregate value of each Fund's net assets as of the end of each month. The Fund Servicing Fee payable to the Servicing Agent will be borne pro rata by all Partners before giving effect to any repurchase of Units in a Fund effective as of that date, and will decrease the net profits or increase the net losses of the Fund that are credited to its Partners. The Servicing Agent may waive (to all investors on a pro-rata basis) or pay to service providers all or a portion of any such fees in its sole discretion. For more information see "FUND SERVICING FEE" above.
Distribution Policy
It is expected that distributions will generally not be made to Partners. However, the Board has the right to cause distributions to be made in cash or in-kind to the Partners in its sole discretion. Whether or not distributions are made, each Partner will be required each year to pay applicable federal, state and local income taxes on its allocable share of the Funds' taxable income.
Closed-End Structure
Each Fund has been organized as a closed-end management investment company. Closed-end funds differ from open-end management investment companies (commonly known as mutual funds) in that beneficial owners of a closed-end fund do not have the right to redeem their Units on a daily basis.
Repurchase Offers

0
In order to provide a limited degree of liquidity to the Partners, each Fund intends to conduct repurchase offers generally quarterly with a Valuation Date (as defined below) on or about March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year, provided that it is in the best interests of the Fund and the Partners to do so as determined by the Board. In each repurchase offer, each Fund intends to offer to repurchase a percentage of its Units at its NAV determined as of approximately March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31, as applicable (each, a "Valuation Date"), but in no event will more than 20% of the Units of a Fund be repurchased per quarter. For purposes of clarification, it should be noted that there is no guarantee that a Fund will offer to repurchase 20% (or any other percentage) of the Units of a Fund in any given quarter. If the value of Units tendered for repurchase exceeds the value a Fund intended to repurchase, the Fund may determine to repurchase less than the full number of Units tendered. In such event, Partners will have their Units repurchased on a pro rata basis, and tendering Partners will not have all of their tendered Units repurchased by the Fund. Partners tendering Units for repurchase will be asked to give written notice of their intent to do so by the date specified in the notice describing the terms of the applicable repurchase offer, which date will be approximately 65 days prior to the date of repurchase by a Fund. A Partner participating in a repurchase offer may be subject to a repurchase fee payable to a Fund equal to 5% of the amount requested if such Partner has been a Partner for less than 12 months prior to the Valuation Date. The minimum value of a repurchase is $50,000, subject to the discretion of the General Partner. See "TENDER OFFERS/OFFERS TO REPURCHASE."
