RISK FACTORS
This section includes all of the principal risks that you will face with an investment in the partnerships. Each risk factor applies equally to each partnership, except where specifically noted.
Trading and Performance Risks
The partnerships' trading is speculative and volatile. The rapid fluctuations in the market prices of futures, forwards, and options make an investment in the partnerships volatile. Volatility is caused by changes in supply and demand relationships; weather; agricultural, trade, fiscal, monetary, and exchange control programs; U.S. and non-U.S. political and economic events and policies; and changes in interest rates. If a trading advisor incorrectly predicts the direction of prices, large losses may occur. As can be seen from the information in the performance capsules for the partnerships on pages 34 to 37; each partnership has experienced volatility in its performance on both a monthly and an annual basis.
The partnerships' trading is highly leveraged, which accentuates the trading profit or trading loss on a trade. The trading advisor for each partnership uses substantial leverage when trading, which could result in immediate and substantial losses. For example, if 10% of the face value of a contract is deposited as margin for that contract, a 10% decrease in the value of the contract would . cause a total loss of the margin deposit. A decrease of more than 10% in the value of the contract would cause a loss greater than the amount of the margin deposit.
The leverage employed by the partnerships in their trading can vary substantially from month to month and can be significantly higher or lower than the averages set forth below. As an example of the leverage employed by the partnerships, set forth below is the average of the underlying value of each partnership's month-end positions for the period March 2007 through February 2008 compared to the average month-end net assets of the partnership during such period.
While the leverage employed on a trade will accentuate the trading profit or loss on that trade, one partnership's overall leverage as compared to another partnership's overall leverage does not necessarily mean that it will be more volatile than the other partnership. This can be seen by a review of the monthly rates of return for the partnerships on pages 164 to 176.
Options trading can be more volatile than futures trading. Each partnership may trade options on futures. Although successful options trading requires many of the same sldlls as successful futures trading, the risks are different. Successful options trading requires a trader to accurately assess near-term market volatility because that volatility is immediately reflected in the price of outstanding options. Correct assessment of market volatility can therefore be of much greater significance in trading options than it is in many long-term futures strategies where volatility does not have as great an effect on the price of a futures contract. During the period March 2007 through February 2008, none of the partnerships engaged in any significant options trading. You should be aware, however, that in the future the partnerships may engage in significant options trading, the level of which could vary significantly.
You should not rely on the past performance of a partnership in deciding to purchase units. Since the future performance of a partnership is unpredictable, each partnership's past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. The past performance of Charter WCM (formerly known as Charter Millburn) and Charter Aspect (formerly known as Charter MSFCM) was achieved, in part, through the efforts of different trading advisors, Millburn Ridgefield Corporation, which traded Charter WCM's assets through September 30, 2006, and VK Capital Inc., which traded Charter Aspect's assets through September 15, 2006. Accordingly, the past
