provision is enacted, the TEI Fund will probably cease to be a tax-efficient vehicle for its shareholders. As proposed, however, the provision would be effective only for taxable years beginning on or after two years from the date of enactment, so there would be some time available initially in which the structure of the Fund might be changed in response to the change in law. That provision was also part of the March 2, 2009, "Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act" introduced by Senator Levin and Congressman Doggett in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act was co-sponsored by three other Senators and fifty-nine other Congressmen, including thirteen members of the House Ways and Means Committee - the committee with initial jurisdiction over Federal tax legislation, however the International Tax Competitiveness Act of 2011 has no co-sponsors.

INVESTMENT-RELATED RISKS
GENERAL INVESTMENT-RELATED RISKS
GENERAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS. The success of a Fund's investment program may be affected by general economic and market conditions, such as interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws, and national and international political circumstances. These factors may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity of investments held by Master Fund in the Adviser Funds and Adviser Accounts and, thus, a Fund's investments. Unexpected volatility or illiquidity could impair a Fund's profitability or result in losses.
HIGHLY VOLATILE MARKETS. Price movements of forwards, futures and other derivative contracts in which an Adviser Fund's or Adviser Account's assets may be invested are influenced by, among other things, interest rates, changing supply and demand relationships, trade, fiscal, monetary and exchange control programs and policies of governments, and national and international political and economic events and policies. The prices of commodities contracts and all derivative instruments, including futures and options, can be highly volatile. In addition, governments from time to time intervene, directly and by regulation, in certain markets, particularly those in currencies, financial instruments, futures and options. Such intervention often is intended directly to influence prices and may, together with other factors, cause all of such markets to move rapidly in the same direction because of, among other things, interest rate fluctuations. Adviser Funds and Adviser Accounts are also subject to the risk of the failure of any exchanges on which their positions trade or of the clearinghouses for those exchanges.
NATURAL RESOURCE AND PRECIOUS METAL INVESTMENTS. Adviser Funds and Adviser Accounts may make investments in natural resources and precious metals, and thus may be susceptible to economic, business or other developments that affect those industries. Natural resources historically have been subject to substantial price fluctuations over short periods of time. Their prices are affected by various factors, including economic conditions, political events, natural disasters, exploration and development success.or failure, and technological changes. In addition, certain natural resources are geographically concentrated, and events in those parts of the world in which such concentration exists may affect their values. The price of gold and other precious metals are affected by unpredictable international monetary and political policies such as currency devaluations or revaluations, economic and social conditions within a country, trade imbalances, or trade or currency restrictions between countries. The markets for those industries therefore are volatile at times, and there may be sharp fluctuations in prices even during periods of rising prices.
ETFs. ETFs are listed and traded on securities exchanges and in over-the-counter markets, and the purchase and sale of these shares involve transaction fees and commissions. In addition, shares of an ETF are issued in "creation units" and are not redeemable individually except upon termination of the ETF. To redeem shares of an ETF held by the Master Fund, the Master Fund must accumulate enough shares of an ETF to reconstitute a creation unit. The liquidity of such Adviser Funds therefore, will depend upon the existence of a secondary market. Also, even though the market price of an ETF is derived from the securities it owns, such price at any given time may be at, below or above the ETF's NAV.
RISKS OF SECURITIES ACTIVITIES OF THE ADVISERS. The Advisers will invest and trade in a variety of different securities, and utilize a variety of investment instruments and techniques. Each security and each instrument and technique involves the risk of loss of capital. While the Investment Manager will attempt to moderate these risks, there can be no assurance that the Master Fund's investment activities will be successful or that the Partners will not suffer losses. See "RISKS OF SECURITIES ACTIVITIES OF THE ADVISERS" and "SPECIAL INVESTMENT INSTRUMENTS AND TECHNIQUES" in the SAI for further information.
DERIVATIVES. Adviser Funds and Adviser Accounts may engage in transactions involving options, futures and other derivative financial instruments. Derivatives can be volatile and involve various types and degrees of risk, depending upon the characteristics of the particular derivative and the portfolio as a whole. Derivatives permit Adviser Funds and Adviser Accounts to increase or decrease the level of risk, or change the character of the risk, to which their portfolios are exposed in much the same way as they can increase or decrease the level of risk, or change the character of the risk, of their portfolios by making investments in specific securities. Special risks may apply to instruments that are invested in by Adviser Funds or Adviser Accounts in the future that cannot be
