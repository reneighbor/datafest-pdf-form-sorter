specified therein and to utilize the net proceeds of such redemption to purchase an amount of units of limited partnership interest of one or more other Charter Series Partnerships as specified in the Exchange Agreement and Power of Attorney. The General Partner shall cause the net proceeds of the redemption to be delivered to the Charter Series Partnership(s) issuing and selling units of limited partnership interest to the redeeming Limited Partner, and shall cause to be mailed to such Limited Partner, within 20 business days after such Exchange Date, a written confirmation thereof.
As of each Exchange Date, the Partnership shall issue and sell Units with a total Net Asset Value equal to the net proceeds of redemptions from limited partners of other Charter Series Partnerships requesting Units on a Series Exchange, provided, that the General Partner, in its capacity as the general partner of each of the Charter Series Partnerships, has (i) timely received a properly executed Exchange Agreement and Power of Attorney verifying that such units of limited partnership interest in the other Charter Series Partnership (s) subject to such Series Exchange are owned by the person requesting such Series Exchange and acknowledging that the limited partner thereof remains eligible to purchase Units, and (ii) caused the net proceeds from units of limited partnership interest in the other Charter Series Partnership(s) being redeemed to be transferred to the Partnership in payment of such Units. Each Unit to be purchased with the net proceeds of a redemption of units of limited partnership interest from another Charter Series Partnership shall be issued and sold by the Partnership at a price per Unit equal to 100% of the Net Asset Value of a Unit as of the close of business on the relevant Exchange Date.
Each Limited Partner understands that its ability to effect a Series Exchange in another Charter Series Partnership is conditioned upon units of limited partnership interest of other Charter Series Partnerships being registered and qualified for sale pursuant to a current Prospectus immediately prior to each Exchange Date. The General Partner shall not have any obligation to have units of limited partnership interest in other Charter Series Partnerships registered under federal, state or non-U.S. securities laws, and may withdraw or terminate such registrations at any time. In the event that not all Exchange Agreements and Powers of Attorney can be processed because an insufficient number of units of limited partnership interest are available for sale on an Exchange Date, the General Partner is hereby authorized to allocate units of limited partnership interest in any manner which it deems is reasonable under the circumstances and may allocate a substantial portion of such units of limited partnership interest to new subscribers for Units.
The General Partner, on behalf of the Partnership and each Partner, is authorized to execute, file, record, and publish such amendments to this Agreement and such other documents as shall be necessary to reflect any Series Exchange pursuant to this Section 10(c).
11. Special Power of Attorney.
Each Limited Partner, by the execution of this Agreement, does irrevocably constitute and appoint the General Partner, with full power of substitution, as his true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact, in his name, place, and stead, (a) to execute, acknowledge, swear to, deliver, file, and record in his behalf in the appropriate public offices and publish: (i) this Agreement and the Certificate of Limited Partnership and amendments thereto; (ii) all instruments that the General Partner deems necessary of appropriate to reflect any amendment, change, or modification of this Agreement or the Certificate of Limited Partnership made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (iii) certificates of assumed name; and (iv) all instruments that the General Partner deems necessary or appropriate to qualify or maintain the qualification of the Partnership to do business as a foreign limited partnership in other jurisdictions; and (b) to admit additional Limited Partners and, to the extent that it is necessary under the laws of any jurisdiction, to execute, deliver, and file amended certificates or agreements of limited partnership or other instruments to reflect such admission. The Power of Attorney granted herein shall be irrevocable and deemed to be a power coupled with an interest and shall survive the incapacity, death, dissolution, liquidation, or termination of a Limited Partner. Each Limited Partner hereby agrees to be bound by any representation made by the General Partner and by any successor thereto acting in good faith pursuant to such Power of Attorney. Each Limited Partner agrees to execute a special Power of Attorney on a document separate from this Agreement. In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and any instruments filed by such attorney-in-fact pursuant to the Power of Attorney granted in this Section 11, this Agreement shall control.
