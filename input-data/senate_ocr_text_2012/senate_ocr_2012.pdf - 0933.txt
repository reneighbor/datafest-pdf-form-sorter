the use of Hedging Instruments, unanticipated changes in interest rates, securities prices or currency exchange rates may result in a poorer overall performance for certain of our private equity fund of funds and Investment Funds than if they had not used such Hedging Instruments.
Private Equity Real Estate Fund of Funds Generally:
Real Estate Market Conditions: Some of the Investment Funds' real estate investment strategies may in some investments be based, in part, upon the preimise that real estate businesses and assets will become available for purchase by such Investment Fund at prices that the Investment Manager of the Investment Fund considers more favorable. Further, the strategy of certain Investment Funds for its real estate investments may rely, in part, upon the continuation of existing market conditions (including, for example, supply and demand characteristics) or, in some circumstances, a recovery or improvement in market conditions over the projected holding period for the real estate investments. No assurance can be given that real estate investments can be acquired or disposed of at favorable prices or that the market for such investments will either remain stable or, as applicable, recover or improve, since this will depend upon events and factors outside the control of the managers of the Investment Funds.
Acquisition and Development Risk: Acquisitions entail risks that investments may not perform in accordance with expectations and that anticipated costs of improvements to bring an acquired property up to the necessary standard for the market position intended for that property may exceed budgeted amounts, as well as general investment risks associated with any new real estate investment. Certain Investment Funds may not be successful in identifying suitable real estate properties or other assets that meet their investment criteria or in consummating acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms.
Risks in Effecting Operating Improvements: In some cases, the success of an Investment Fund's real estate investment strategy will depend, in part, on the ability of such Investment Fund to restructure and effect improvements in the operations of a portfolio company or its properties. The activity of identifying and implementing restructuring programs and operating improvements at portfolio companies entails a high degree of uncertainty. There can be no assurance that such Investment Fund will be able to successfully identify and implement such restructuring programs and improvements.
Commercial/Business Risks: It is anticipated that certain of our private equity real estate fund of funds will make investments in some Investment Funds, including Mil, that have a limited operating history, a manager with limited private equity real estate fund management experience, or both. Such investments have inherently greater risk than more established private equity real estate funds. Accordingly, the growth of these Investment Funds may require significant time and effort resulting in a longer investment horizon than can be expected with lower risk investment alternatives. Such investments can experience failure or substantial declines in value at any stage. There is no assurance that such investments by certain of our private equity real estate fund of funds will be successful.
