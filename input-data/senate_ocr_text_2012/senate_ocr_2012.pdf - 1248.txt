Description of Trading Methods and Strategies
Winton's investment technique consists of trading a portfolio of more than 100 commodity interests on major commodity exchanges and forward markets worldwide, employing a computerized, technical, trend-following trading system developed by its principals. This system tracks the daily price movements and other data from these markets around the world, and carries out certain computations to determine each day how long or short the portfolio should be to maximize profit within a certain range of risk. If rising prices are anticipated, a long position will be established; a short position will be established if prices are expected to fall.
The trading methods applied by Winton are proprietary, complex and confidential. As a result, the following discussion is of necessity general in nature and not intended to be exhaustive. Winton plans to continue the research and development of its trading methodology and, therefore, retains the right to revise any methods or strategy, including the technical trading factors used, the markets traded and/or the money management principles applied.
A Technical Trend-Following System. Technical analysis refers to analysis based on data intrinsic to a market, such as price and volume. This is to be contrasted with fundamental analysis which relies on factors external to a market, such as supply and demand. The Diversified Trading Program uses no fundamental factors.
A trend-following system is one that attempts to take advantage of the observable tendency of the markets to trend, and to tend to make exaggerated movements in both upward and downward directions as a result of such trends. These exaggerated movements are largely explained as a result of the influence of crowd psychology or the herd instinct, amongst market participants. A trend-following system does not anticipate a trend, In fact, trend-following systems are frequently unprofitable for long periods of time in particular markets or market groups, and occasionally they are unprofitable for spells of more than a year, even in large portfolios. However, over a span of years, Winton believes such an approach, applied to a sufficiently diversified portfolio of markets will be profitable.
The Winton trading system has been developed by relating the probability of the size and direction of future price movements with certain indicators derived from past price movements which characterize the degree of trending of each market at any time. Winton believes its application of advanced classical statistics to the understanding of market behavior provides it with an edge over other trend following systems. Winton believes this enables its system to suffer smaller losses during the inevitable whipsaw periods of market behavior and thus take better advantage of the significant trends when they occur, by focusing more resources on them.
A Non Discretionary System. Trade selection is not subject to intervention by Winton's principals or traders and therefore is not subject to the influences of individual judgment. As a mechanical trading system, the Winton model utilizes expert knowledge to analyze market data and direct trades, thus eliminating the risk of basing a trading program on one indispensable person. Equally important is the fact that mechanical systems can be tested in simulation for long periods of time and the model's empirical characteristics can be measured.
The system's output is rigorously adhered to in trading the portfolio and intentionally no importance is given to any external or fundamental factors. While it may be seen as unwise to ignore information of obvious value, such as that pertaining to political or economic developments, Winton believes the disadvantage of this approach is far outweighed by the advantage of the discipline that rigorous adherence to such a system instills. Significant profits are often made by the Winton system, by holding on to positions for much longer than conventional wisdom would dictate. An individual taking trading decisions, and paying attention to day-to-day events, could easily be deflected from the chance of fully capitalizing on such trends, when not adhering to such a system.
