The Management Fee will be paid to the Investment Manager before giving effect to any repurchase of interests in the Master Fund effective as of that date, and will decrease the net profits or increase the net losses of the Master Fund that are credited to its interest holders, including the Fund. In addition, the General Partner of the Master Fund will be allocated a Performance Allocation (as defined below) that is equal to 10% of the excess of the new net profits of the limited partner interests of the Master Fund (calculated and accrued monthly and payable annually and calculated separately for the TEI Fund, the Core Alternatives Fund and each other fund that serves as a feeder fund to the Master Fund) over the yield-to-maturity of the 90 day U.S. Treasury Bill as reported by the Wall Street Journal for the last business day of the preceding calendar year of the Master Fund.
(5)	"Other Expenses" includes direct expenses of the Fund as well as indirect expenses of the Master Fund. Directors' fees, insurance costs and other costs have been allocated pro-rata among the Master Fund and all of its feeder funds (including the Fund). Partners also indirectly bear a portion of the asset-based fees, performance and incentive fees or allocations and other expenses incurred by the Master Fund as an investor in Adviser Funds or Adviser Accounts. "Other Expenses" are based on estimated amounts for the current fiscal year and also includes the Fund Servicing Fee. The Fund Servicing Fee payable to the Investment Manager will be borne pro-rata by all Partners of the Fund. See "FUND SERVICING FEE'' for additional information.

The Adviser Funds generally charge, in addition to management fees calculated as a percentage of the average NAV of the Fund's investment, performance-based fees generally from 10% to 35% of the net capital appreciation in the Fund's investment for the year or other measurement period. The fees and expenses indicated are calculated based on estimated amounts for the current fiscal year. In the future, these fees and expenses may be substantially higher or lower than reflected, because certain fees are based on the performance of the Advisers, which fluctuate over time. In addition, the Master Fund's portfolio changes from time to time, which will result in different Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.
