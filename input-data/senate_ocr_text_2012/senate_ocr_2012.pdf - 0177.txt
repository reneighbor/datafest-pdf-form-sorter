EXEMPTION TEST (see instructions before marking box). If you omitted any asset because it meets the three-part test for exemption described in the instructions, please check box to the right. This category applies only if the asset is/was held independently by the spouse or dependent child. If the asset is/was either held by the filer or jointly held, use the other categories of value, as appropriate.
