Hedgers and Speculators
The two broad classes of persons who trade futures, forward, and options contracts are "hedgers" and "speculators." Commercial interests, including farmers, that market or process commodities, and financial institutions that market or deal in commodities, including interest rate sensitive instruments, foreign currencies, and stocks, which are exposed to currency, interest rate, and stock market risks, may use the futures markets for hedging. Hedging is a protective procedure designed to minimize losses that may occur because of price fluctuations occurring, for example, between the time a processor makes a contract to buy or sell a raw or processed commodity at a certain price and the time he must perform the contract. The futures markets enable the hedger to shift the risk of price fluctuations to the speculator. The speculator risks his capital with the hope of making profits from price fluctuations in futures, forward, and options contracts. Speculators rarely take delivery of commodities, but rather close out their positions by entering into offsetting purchases or sales of futures, forward, and options contracts. Since the speculator may take either . a long or short position in the futures, forward, and options markets, it is possible for him to make profits or incur losses regardless of whether prices go up or down. The partnerships will trade for speculative rather than for hedging purposes.
Futures Exchanges
Futures exchanges provide centralized market facilities for trading futures contracts and options (but not forward contracts). Members of, and trades executed on, a particular exchange are subject to the rules of that exchange. Among the principal exchanges in the U.S. are the Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, and the New York Board of Trade.
Each futures exchange in the U.S. has an associated "clearinghouse." Once trades between members of an exchange have been confirmed, the clearinghouse becomes substituted for each buyer and each seller of contracts traded on the exchange and, in effect, becomes the other party to each trader's open position in the market. Thereafter, each party to a trade looks only to the clearinghouse for performance. The clearinghouse generally establishes some sort of security or guarantee fund to which all clearing members of the exchange must contribute; this fund acts as an emergency buffer that enables the clearinghouse to meet its obligations with regard to the "other side" of an insolvent clearing member's contracts. Clearinghouses require margin deposits and continuously mark positions to market to provide some assurance that their members will be able to fulfill their contractual obligations. Thus, a central function of the clearinghouses is to ensure the integrity of trades, and members effecting futures transactions on an organized exchange need not worry about the solvency of the party on the opposite side of the trade; their only remaining concerns are the respective solvencies of their commodity broker and the clearinghouse.
Non-U.S. futures exchanges differ in certain respects from their U.S. counterparts. In contrast to U.S. exchanges, certain non-U.S. exchanges are "principals' markets," where trades remain the liability of the traders involved, and the exchange does not become substituted for any party. See "Regulations" beginning on page 129 and "Risk Factors — Trading and Performance Risks — Trading on non-U.S. exchanges presents greater risks to each partnership than trading on U.S. exchanges" on page 13.
Speculative Position Limits
The CFTC and U.S. futures exchanges have established limits, referred to as "speculative position limits" or "position limits," on the maximum net long or net short speculative position that any person or group of persons (other than a hedger, which the partnerships are not) may hold, own, or control in certain futures or options contracts. Among the purposes of speculative position limits is to prevent a "corner" on a market or undue influence on prices by any single trader or group of traders. The CFTC has jurisdiction to establish position limits with respect to all commodities and has established position limits for all agricultural commodities. In addition, the
