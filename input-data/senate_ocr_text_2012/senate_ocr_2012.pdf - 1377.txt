INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Demeter Management Corporation:
We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of Demeter Management Corporation (the "Company"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, as of November 30, 2007 and 2006. These statements of financial condition are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards as established by the Auditing Standards Board (United States) and in accordance with the auditing standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to . perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the statements of financial condition, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall statement of Financial condition presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such statements of financial condition present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at November 30, 2007 and 2006, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
