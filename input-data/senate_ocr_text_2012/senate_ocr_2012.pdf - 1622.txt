Mr. John Sassaman Senate Select Committee on Ethics 220 Hart Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510
Re: Linda Lingle Candidate Public Financial Disclosure Report Dear Mr. Sassaman:
This letter responds to your letters of January 19,2012 and March 2, 2012 to Governor Linda Lingle regarding her candidate public financial disclosure report that was filed with the Senate Select Committee on Ethics ("the Committee") on November 10,2011.
The letters requested clarification on whether Governor Lingle received earned income from the Linda Lingle Trust and Republican Jewish Coalition during the reporting period. The letters further requested that Governor Lingle notify the Committee by letter, fax, or telephone if no further information was required.
As Governor Lingle indicated to John Lewter of the Committee by telephone and in the attached email dated January 30, 2012, she did not receive earned income from the Linda Lingle Trust or Republican Jewish Coalition during the reporting period.
If you have any further questions regarding this matter, please contact me.
Sincerely,
Michael E. Toner
