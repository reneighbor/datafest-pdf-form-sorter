For advisory services rendered to the Funds pursuing a private equity real estate fund of funds investment strategy and for certain of the Funds pursuing a private equity fund of funds investment strategy, we are entitled to a fee that ranges (on an annualized basis) from 0.90% to 1.50% (depending on your capital commitment). This fee schedule is applicable for the period prior to the fifth anniversary of the due date of the Fund's first capital call. Thereafter, the management fee will equal the Management Fee Percentage (as defined below) of your capital commitment. The "Management Fee Percentage" means a percentage equal to 75% of the percentage used to calculate the management fee for the preceding year.
