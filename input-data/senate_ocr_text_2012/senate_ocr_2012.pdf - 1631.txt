Requested Clarification - Candidate Public Disclosure Report
Dear Mr Sassaman, •
i i
I have received a request for further information or clarification relating to Part X of my candidate pubMc disclosure report
This related to compensation in excess of $5,000 from one source, and specifically the requirement to report #f the names of clients and customers of the firm that generate^ the payment.
I do not believe that reasons:
any further information is required, for the following
i
1.	Hecla Mining Company: Services were provided solely to the company, and not to any clients/customers of Hecla Mining Company.
i
2.	Civilian Police International: Sole client/customer was the US Department of State. My understanding was that there is not a requirement to report the US Government as a sounie of income.
If you need additionial information, or my interpretation of the reporting requirement is not correct, please be in touch. It is very much my intention to be
fully in compliance witih my public disclosure obligations.
i
Sincerely,
Michael J. Baumgartner
