In some instances, an investment in the Fund by a private foundation may be prohibited by the "excess business holdings" provisions of the Code. For example, if a private foundation (either directly or together with a "disqualified person") acquires, indirectly, more than 20% of the capital interest or profits interest in the Master Fund, the private foundation may be considered to have "excess business holdings." If this occurs, such foundation may be required to divest itself of its units in the Fund to avoid the imposition of an excise tax. However, the excise tax will not apply if at least 95% of the gross income from the Master Fund is "passive" within the applicable provisions of the Code and Regulations. Although there can be no assurance, the General Partner believes that the Master Fund will meet this 95% gross income test.
A substantial percentage of investments of certain "private operating foundations" may be restricted to assets directly devoted to their tax-exempt purposes. Otherwise, generally, rules similar to those discussed above govern their operations.
Endowment Funds. Investment managers of endowment funds should consider whether the acquisition of Units is legally permissible. This is not a matter of federal law, but is determined under state statutes. It should be noted, however, that under the Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act, which has been adopted, in various forms, by a large number of states, participation in investment partnerships or similar organizations in which funds are commingled and investment determinations are made by persons other than the governing board of the endowment fund is allowed.
State and Local Taxation
In addition to the federal income tax consequences described above, prospective investors should consider potential state and local tax consequences of an investment in the Fund. State and local laws often differ from federal income tax laws with respect to the treatment of specific items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit. A Partner's allocable share of the taxable income or loss of the Fund generally will be required to be included in determining the Partner's reportable income for state and local tax purposes in the jurisdiction in which he is a resident. A partnership in which the Master Fund acquires an interest may conduct business in a jurisdiction that will subject to tax a Partner's share of the partnership's income from that business. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisers with respect to the availability of a credit for such tax in their jurisdiction of residence.
ERISA Plans and Other Tax-Exempt Entities
Prospective investors subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA") and/or Section 4975 of the Code, including employee benefit plans, individual retirement accounts, and Keogh plans, and other tax-exempt entities, may not purchase or hold Units in the Core Alternatives Fund (except to the extent a tax-exempt entity is an investor in a Partner, provided such Partner is not an entity the underlying assets of which constitute the assets of a plan(s) subject to ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code). The Fund's assets will not constitute "plan assets" for purposes of ERISA's fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules or similar provisions of the Code because of the Fund's registration under the 1940 Act.

Taxation of the Offshore Fund
The tax status of the Offshore Fund and its members under the tax laws of the Cayman Islands and the United States is summarized below. The summary is based on the assumption that the Offshore Fund is owned, managed, and operated as contemplated, and on the assumption that shares of the Offshore Fund will be held by the Fund and that Units of the Fund will be held by tax-exempt investors. The summary is based on existing laws as applied on the date of this Prospectus but no representation is made or intended (i) that changes in such laws or their application or interpretation will not be made in the future or (ii) that the IRS will agree with the interpretation described below. Prospective investors should consult their own tax and legal advisers with respect to the tax consequences of the purchase, holding, redemption, sale, or transfer of Interests.
The Offshore Fund will be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Aside from certain 30% withholding taxes (discussed below), the Offshore Fund generally will not be subject to taxation by the $9 United States on income or gain realized by the Master Fund from its stock, securities, commodities or derivatives trading for a Jfi taxable year, provided that the Offshore Fund is not engaged or deemed to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business during a taxable year W to which any such income, gain, or loss of the Master Fund is treated as effectively connected. An investment in the Master Fund should not, by itself, cause the Offshore Fund to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business for the foregoing purpose, so long as (1) the §2 Master Fund is not considered a dealer in stock, securities or commodities and does not regularly offer to enter into, assume, offset, assign or otherwise terminate positions in derivatives with customers, (2) the U.S. business activities of the Master Fund consist solely Ja of trading in stock, securities, commodities, and derivatives for its own account (and, in the case of commodities, is limited to trading
