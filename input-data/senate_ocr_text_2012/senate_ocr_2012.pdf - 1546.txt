To Whom It May Concern:
On February 2nd, the Select Committee on Ethics provided a written request for clarification of Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald's financial disclosure report. After a telephone conversation with John Lewter from the Committee, it was agreed that there was no need for further explanation due do a misunderstanding in regards to the annuity of Speaker Fitzgerald's participation in the Wisconsin Retirement System Employee Trust Fund.
The confusion stems from the type of annuity that has not been selected for the Wisconsin Retirement System Employee Trust Fund on Part IIIA- Publicly Traded Assets and Unearned Income Sources of the disclosure. To make decisions in regards the annuity option, the individual state employee must be eligible to retire. Because Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald is ineligible to retire at this time, he is unable to make any decisions on the annuity payment type. For evidence of this, you will find the inclusion of a copy of the Wisconsin Department of Employee Trust Fund's handbook. Page 3 explains the annuity options while Page 2 explains eligibility to retire at which point one could decide the annuity type.
If further clarification is required, please feel free to call or email me at (608) 285-5666 or amy.harriman@fitzgeraIdforwisconsin.com.
Sincerely,
