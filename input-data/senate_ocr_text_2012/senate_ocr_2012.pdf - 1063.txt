If an investor incurs debt to finance the acquisition of a Unit, that acquisition indebtedness will separately cause income and gain from the TEI Fund to become UBTI under the rules applicable to debt-financed income. Each investor should consult its own tax adviser to determine whether any particular indebtedness of that investor may give rise to such debt-financed income as a result of an investment in the TEI Fund.
The foregoing discussion is intended to apply primarily to exempt organizations that are tax-qualified plans. The UBTI of certain other exempt organizations may be computed in accordance with special rules. Further, certain types of tax-exempt entities under the Code, such as "charitable remainder trusts" that are required to make taxable distributions based upon income received from all sources, may be disadvantaged under the rules relating to CFCs in a manner similar to taxable investors. Charitable remainder trusts are generally required, under their trust instruments and for purposes of qualifying under the Code for tax exemption, to make current distributions of all or a significant portion of their income. As an investor in a CFC, such a trust would be deemed to receive income each year from the CFC whether or not the CFC currently distributes such income. For these reasons, the Fund is not an appropriate investment for a charitable remainder trust.
U.S. TAX-EXEMPT INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISERS CONCERNING THE U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF ANY INVESTMENT IN A FUND.
Investment by Benefit Plans and IRAs
This section sets forth certain consequences under ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code which a fiduciary of an "employee benefit plan" as defined in and subject to ERISA (an "ERISA Plan") or of a "plan" as defined in and subject to Section 4975 of the Code should consider before investing or deciding to invest the plan's assets in the TEI Fund (such ERISA Plans and other "plans" being referred to herein as "Plans," and such fiduciaries being referred to herein as "Plan Fiduciaries"). The following summary is not intended to be complete, but only to address certain questions under ERISA and the Code which are likely to be raised by the Plan Fiduciary's own counsel.
In general, the terms "employee benefit plan" as defined in ERISA and "plan" as defined in Section 4975 of the Code together refer to any plan or account of various types which provide retirement benefits or welfare benefits to an individual or to an employer's employees and their beneficiaries. Such plans and accounts include, but are not limited to, pension and profit-sharing plans (including "Section 401(k) plans"), "simplified employee pension plans," non-ERISA Keogh plans for self-employed individuals (including partners), IRAs, and medical benefit plans.
Each Plan Fiduciary of an ERISA Plan who has investment discretion must give appropriate consideration to the facts and circumstances that are relevant to an investment in the TEI Fund, including the role an investment in the TEI Fund plays in the ERISA Plan's investment portfolio and the projected return of the ERISA Plan's total portfolio relative to the ERISA Plan's funding objectives. Each such Plan Fiduciary of an ERISA Plan, before deciding to invest in the TEI Fund, must be satisfied that investment in the TEI Fund is a prudent investment for the ERISA Plan, that the investments of the ERISA Plan, including the investment in the TEI Fund, are diversified so as to minimize the risk of large losses (unless, under the circumstances, it is clearly prudent not to do so), and that an investment in the TEI Fund complies with the documents of the ERISA Plan and related trust. If a Plan Fiduciary of an ERISA Plan breaches his or her fiduciary responsibilities with regard to selecting an investment for an ERISA Plan, the Plan Fiduciary may be held personally liable for losses incurred by the ERISA Plan as a result of such breach.
A Plan Fiduciary of an ERISA Plan, such as a directed trustee, who invests ERISA Plan assets in the TEI Fund at the direction of another Plan Fiduciary or, in the case of a participant-directed ERISA Plan, at the direction of an ERISA Plan participant or beneficiary, generally has only limited fiduciary responsibility under ERISA with respect to the investment. Also, a Plan Fiduciary who has control over the availability of investments in a participant-directed ERISA Plan has fiduciary responsibility to monitor such investments. Such Plan Fiduciaries should consult with legal counsel to ensure that investment in the TEI Fund is consistent with their fiduciary responsibilities under ERISA.
Because the TEI Fund will be registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act, the underlying assets of the TEI Fund will- not be considered "plan assets" of the Plans investing in the TEI Fund for purposes of ERISA's fiduciary responsibility and '®P prohibited transaction rules or the prohibited transaction rules of Section 4975 of the Code. Thus, the Investment Manager will not, solely as a result of the Plan's investment in the TEI Fund, be a fiduciary with respect to the assets of any Plan that becomes a Partner m of the TEI Fund.

The Board will require a Plan proposing to invest in the TEI Fund to represent that it, and any fiduciaries responsible for the Plan's investments, are aware of and understand the TEI Fund's investment objective, policies, and strategies, that the decision to invest Plan assets in the TEI Fund was made with appropriate consideration of relevant investment factors with regard to the Plan, and, with respect to an ERISA Plan, that the decision to invest ERISA Plan assets in the TEI Fund is consistent with the duties and
flrjj) responsibilities imposed upon fiduciaries with regard to their investment decisions under ERISA.
