RE: Your letter of Jan. 19, 2012
John C. Sassaman, Chief Counsel & Staff Director Select Committee on Ethics Hart Senate Office Building, Room 220 Second and Constitution Avenue, NE Washington, DC 20510-6425
Dear Mr. Sassaman,
I am in receipt of your letter dated January 19, 2012. The information that you are looking for, as I understand, does not relate to the listing of individual stocks in which our retirement mutual funds were invested. But rather, the items you are looking for are the names of the specific mutual fund product within the family of funds offered by each company we utilized listed in 1 - 6 in the attached form.
For items 1 - 6, the following are the specific product names for each mutual fund or financial products company:
p *
1.	American Century Ultra
2.	Select American Shares Class D
\
3.	T Rowe Price Retirement 2040
4.	T Rowe Price Equity Funds
5.	American Century Selected American Shares
6.	State Bank and Trust, Fargo, ND Certificates of Deposit.
If this does not satisfy your disclosure requirements, I am at a loss to provide additional information th^t A^ou don't already have.
Since

4 - 1 '	.'
Paul Sorum
