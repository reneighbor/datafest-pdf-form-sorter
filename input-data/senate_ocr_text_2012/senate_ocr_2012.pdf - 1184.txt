be advised if adjustments are made to a trading advisor's trading program in order to accommodate additional assets under management or for any other reason.

Taxation Risks
Even though the partnerships do not intend to make distributions, you will be liable for taxes on your share of any trading profits and any other income of the partnerships in which you have invested. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, if a partnership in which you own units has taxable income for a year, that income will be taxable to you in accordance with your allocable share of income from the partnership, whether or not any amounts have been distributed to you. The general partner presently does not intend to make distributions from the partnerships. Accordingly, it is anticipated that you will incur tax liabilities as a result of being allocated taxable income from a partnership even though you will not receive current cash distributions with which to pay the taxes.
The partnerships' tax returns could be audited. The IRS could audit a partnership's tax return. If an audit results in an adjustment to a partnership's tax return, you could be required to file an amended tax return.
A portion of the profits on each partnership's trading activities will cause you to recognize short-term capital gain. Profits on futures contracts traded on regulated U.S. and some non-U.S. exchanges, certain foreign currency contracts traded in the interbank market, and U.S. and some non-U.S. exchange-traded options on commodities are generally treated as short-term capital gain to the extent of 40% of the gain and currently taxed at a maximum marginal tax rate of 35%. A partnership's trading gains from open contracts are expected to be primarily short-term capital gains. Losses on units may generally be deducted against capital gains. However, capital losses in excess of capital gains may only be deducted against ordinary income to the extent of $3,000 per year. Consequently, you could pay tax on a partnership's interest income even though you have lost money on your units.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
While the general partner and the commodity brokers, and their affiliates, will seek to avoid conflicts of interest to the extent feasible and to resolve all conflicts that may arise equitably and in a manner consistent with their responsibilities to the partnerships, no specific policies regarding conflicts of interest have been or are intended to be adopted by the general partner or the partnerships. The following are actual and potential conflicts of interest that do and may continue to exist with respect to the partnerships.
