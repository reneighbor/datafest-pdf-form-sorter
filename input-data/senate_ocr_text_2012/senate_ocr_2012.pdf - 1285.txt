Cash Distributions and Redemptions
Because of the special allocation of partnership gain or loss upon a redemption of units, the amounts received upon the partial or complete redemption of a limited partner's units normally will not result in additional taxable income or loss to the limited partner. However, distributions by a partnership and amounts received upon the partial or complete redemption of a limited partner's units will be taxable to the limited partners to the extent cash distributions by a partnership or amounts received upon redemption by a limited partner exceed such partner's adjusted tax basis in his units. Such excess will be taxable to him as though it were a gain from a sale of the units. A loss will be recognized upon a redemption of units only if, following the redemption of all of a limited partner's units, the partner has any tax basis in his units remaining. In such case, the limited partner will recognize loss to the extent of the remaining basis. See "Redemptions." Generally, if a limited partner is not a "dealer" with respect to his interest in the partnership and he has held his interest in the partnership for more than one year, the gain or loss would be long-term capital gain or loss.
Gain or Loss on Trading Activity
Nature of Partnership Income. Each partnership does not expect to hold its futures, forwards, or options for sale to customers. For U.S. federal income tax purposes substantially all of the profit and loss generated by each partnership from its trading activities is expected to be capital gain and loss, which in turn may be either short-term, long-term, or a combination thereof. Nevertheless, certain foreign currency transactions could result in ordinary gain or loss, as discussed below. Further, interest paid to a partnership will be taxable currently to the limited partners as ordinary income. Thus, during taxable years in which little or no profit is generated from trading activities, or even during taxable years in which the net asset value per unit has decreased due to trading losses, a limited partner may still have interest income.
Mark-to-Market. Section 1256 contracts held at the end of a partnership's taxable year will be treated as having been sold for the fair market value on the last day of the taxable year, and gain or loss will be taken into account for the year. Gain or loss with respect to a Section 1256 contract is generally treated as short-term capital gain or loss to the extent of 40% of the gain or loss, and long-term capital gain or loss to the extent of 60% of the gain or loss. Section 1256 contracts include regulated futures contracts which are futures contracts traded on regulated U.S. and certain non-U.S. exchanges; foreign currency contracts that are traded in the interbank market and relate to currencies for which positions are also traded through regulated futures contracts; and U.S. and certain non-U.S. exchange-traded options on commodities, including options on regulated futures contracts, debt securities, and stock indices. While the partnerships expect that a majority of their trading activities will be conducted in Section 1256 contracts, the partnerships also expect that a portion of their trading activities will be conducted in contracts that do not presently qualify as Section 1256 contracts, such as positions in futures contracts on most non-U.S. exchanges and foreign currency forward contracts that do not relate to currencies for which positions are also traded through regulated futures contracts.
Subject to certain limitations, a limited partner, other than a corporation, estate, or trust, may elect to carry back net Section 1256 contract losses to each of the three preceding years. Net Section 1256 contract losses carried back to prior years may only be used to offset net Section 1256 contract gains. Generally, such losses are carried back as 40% short-term capital losses and 60% long-term capital losses. Capital assets not marked to market under Section 1256, such as any non-currency forward contracts, are not subject to the 60/40 tax regime for Section 1256 contracts, and gain or loss on sale generally will be long-term only if such property has been held for more than one year.
Gain or Loss on Non-Section 1256 Contracts. Except as described below with respect to "Section 988 transactions" entered into by a "qualified fund" or as a result of a "mixed straddle account" election, gain or loss with respect to contracts that are not Section 1256 contracts will be taken into account for tax purposes only when realized.
