Negative Basis Partners (as defined in this Section 5.8) withdraw from the Partnership under Article IV or VI of this Agreement, the General Partner may elect to allocate net losses as follows: (i) to allocate net losses among Negative Basis Partners, in proportion to the Negative Basis (as defined in this Section 5.8) of each Negative Basis Partner, until either the full amount of net losses will have been so allocated or the Negative Basis of each Negative Basis Partner has been eliminated, and (ii) to allocate any net losses not so allocated to Negative Basis Partners, to the other Partners in a manner that reflects equitably the amounts credited to the Partners' Capital Accounts.

As used in this Section 5.8, the term "Positive Basis Partner" means any Partner who or that withdraws from the Partnership and who or that has a Positive Basis as of the effective date of the Partner's withdrawal. As used in this Section 5.8, the term "Negative Basis" means, with respect to any Partner and as of any time of calculation, the amount by which the Partner's "adjusted tax basis," for U.S. federal income tax purposes, in the Partner's Units in the Partnership as of that time (determined without regard to any adjustments made to the "adjusted tax basis" by reason of any Transfer or assignment of Units, including by reason of death, and without regard to such Partner's share of the liabilities of the Partnership under section 752 of the Code) exceeds the Partner's Capital Account as of such time.
