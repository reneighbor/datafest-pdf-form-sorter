Distressed Securities strategies entail investing in the debt of companies experiencing significant financial or operational difficulties that often lead to bankruptcies, exchange offers, workouts, financial reorganizations, and other special credit event-related situations. These companies are generally experiencing even greater difficulties than companies in the "high yield" category. These securities generally trade at significant discounts to par value, because of these difficulties and because certain classes of investors are precluded, based on their investment mandates, from holding low-credit instruments. Profits are generally made based on two kinds of mispricings: (1) fundamental or intrinsic value; and (2) relative value between comparable securities. The Investment Manager believes that the main competencies required to successfully implement these strategies lie in correctly valuing the intricacies of distressed businesses and industries as well as in adequately assessing the period over which the capital will be invested.
Distressed Securities Advisers may seek to identify distressed securities in general or focus on one particular segment of the market (such as the senior secured debt sector, subordinated notes, trade claims or distressed real estate obligations) depending on their expertise and prior experience. Additionally, Distressed Securities Adviser Funds may be diversified across passive investments in the secondary market, participations in merger and acquisition activity, or active participation in a re-capitalization or restructuring plan. It is important to note that some or all of these factors may not be included in the construction of this portion of the portfolio. Distressed Securities Advisers may actively attempt to modify or improve a restructuring plan with the intent of improving the value of such securities upon consummation of a restructuring. Additionally, they may take an active role and seek representation in management on a board of directors or a creditors' committee. In order to achieve these objectives, Distressed Securities Advisers may purchase, sell, exchange, or otherwise deal in and with restricted or marketable securities including, without limitation, any type of debt security, preferred or common stock, warrants, options, and hybrid instruments.
Advisers utilizing the Structured Credit strategy invest in tranched securities issued by synthetic collateralized debt obligations by creating custom securities to go both long and short credits. Such investments include residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and other collateralized debt obligations ("CDOs").
CDOs are debt instruments backed by a pool of other debt securities. CDOs include collateralized bond obligations ("CBOs") and collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs") and other similarly structured securities. A CBO is a trust or other special purpose entity that is typically backed by a diversified pool of fixed-income securities (which may include high risk, below investment grade securities). A CLO is a trust or other special purpose entity that is typically collateralized by a pool of loans, which may include, among others, domestic and non-U.S. senior secured loans, senior unsecured loans, and subordinate corporate loans, including loans that may be rated below investment grade or equivalent unrated loans.
Each mortgage pool underlying residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities consists of mortgage loans evidenced by promissory notes secured by mortgages or deeds of trust or other similar security instruments creating a lien on owner occupied and non-owner occupied residential, commercial or mixed use properties. The investment characteristics of adjustable and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities differ from those of traditional fixed-income securities. The major differences include the payment of interest and principal on mortgage-backed securities on a more frequent (usually monthly) schedule, and the possibility that principal may be prepaid at any time due to prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans or other assets.
Asset-backed securities represent participations in, or are secured by and payable from, assets such as motor vehicle installment sales, installment loan contracts, leases of various types of real and personal property, receivables from revolving credit (credit card) agreements and other categories of receivables. Such assets are securitized through the use of trusts and special purpose corporations. Payments or distributions of principal and interest may be guaranteed up to certain amounts and for a certain time period by a letter of credit or a pool insurance policy issued by a financial institution unaffiliated with the trust or corporation, or other credit enhancements may be present.
Opportunistic Credit Advisers take long or short positions in credit markets. This strategy includes global debt investing, which involves purchasing debt securities including bonds, notes and debentures issued predominantly by non-U.S. corporations; debt securities issued predominantly by non-U.S. Governments; or debt securities guaranteed by non-U.S. Governments or any agencies thereof. Global debt investing generally consist of Adviser Funds investing in global fixed income portfolios and/or emerging markets debt securities. The Master Fund may invest in more than one Opportunistic Credit Adviser, with a goal of gaining diversification.
