Straddles. If a partnership incurs a loss upon the disposition of any position which is part of a "straddle" (i.e., two or more offsetting positions), recognition of that loss for tax purposes will be deferred until the partnership recognizes the gain in the offsetting position of the straddle (or successor position, or offsetting position to the successor position). Interest and other carrying charges allocable to positions which are part of a straddle must be capitalized, rather than deducted currently. Certain modified "short sale" rules may apply to positions held by a partnership so that what might otherwise be characterized as long-term capital gain would be characterized as short-term capital gain or potential short-term capital loss as long-term capital loss.
For purposes of applying the above rules restricting the deductibility of losses with respect to offsetting positions, if a limited partner takes into account gain or loss with respect to a position held by the partnership, the limited partner will be treated as holding the partnership's position, except to the extent otherwise provided in regulations. Accordingly, positions held by a partnership may limit the deductibility of realized losses sustained by a limited partner with respect to positions held for his own account, and positions held by a limited partner for his own account may limit his ability to deduct realized losses sustained by a partnership. Thus, straddles may not be used to defer gain from one taxable year to the next. Reporting requirements generally require taxpayers to disclose all unrecognized gains with respect to positions held at the end of the taxable year. The above principle, whereby a limited partner may be treated as holding partnership positions, may also apply to require a limited partner to capitalize (rather than deduct) interest and ' carrying charges allocable to property held by him.
Where the positions of a straddle are comprised of both Section 1256 and non-Section 1256 contracts, a partnership will be subject to the mixed straddle rules of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The appropriate tax treatment of any gains and losses from trading in mixed straddles will depend on what elections a partnership makes. Each partnership has elected, and intends to maintain, one or more mixed straddle accounts. The mixed straddle account rules require a daily marking to the market of all open positions and a netting of gains and losses each day. As a result of a partnership electing to establish one or more mixed straddle accounts, the general partner expects, although it cannot assure, that all trading positions of a partnership in respect of commodities (other than financials and currencies) will be treated as marked-to-market on a daily basis. The annual net gain or loss from the mixed straddle accounts will be recognized in each taxable year of each partnership.
The Treasury Regulations governing mixed straddle accounts require a daily marking-to-market of all positions and a daily (as well as annual) netting of gains and losses. No more than 50% of total annual account net gain for the taxable year can be treated as long-term capital gain and not more than 40% of total annual account net loss for the taxable year can be treated as short-term capital loss.
In the event any offsetting positions are not included in the mixed straddle accounts which may be established by a partnership, such offsetting positions will be subject to the other straddle rules described above, including deferral of loss to the extent of any unrecognized gain in offsetting positions held at the close of a partnership's taxable year. In addition, long-term capital gain may be re-characterized as short-term capital gain and short-term capital loss as long-term capital loss.
LA	Taxation of Foreign Currency Transactions. Certain of the trading activities of a partnership
QUA	will be "Section 988 transactions." Section 988 transactions include entering into or acquiring any
^	forward contract, futures contract or similar instrument if the amount paid or received is
denominated in terms of a nonfunctional currency or is determined by reference to the value of
jyj	one or more nonfunctional currencies. In general, foreign currency gain or loss on Section 988
jfyQ	transactions is characterized as ordinary income or loss except that gain or loss on regulated
