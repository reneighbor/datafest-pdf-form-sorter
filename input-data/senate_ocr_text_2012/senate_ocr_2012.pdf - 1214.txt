Additional gains of approximately 0.6% were experienced within the global stock index sector, primarily during January, April, and May from long positions in German and Hong Kong equity index futures as prices increased on continued optimism about the future of the global economy, as well as strong corporate earnings and increased merger and acquisition activity. In addition, Hong Kong equity index futures prices increased in September and October amid strength in the technology sector, thereby resulting in further gains from long futures positions. Smaller gains of approximately 0.2% were recorded within the metals sector, primarily during February, April, September, October, and December, from long futures positions in gold as prices moved higher due to a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar and uncertainty regarding the future direction of the global economy.

2006 Results. The most significant trading losses of approximately 7.1% were recorded in the currency markets during the first quarter from long U.S. dollar positions versus the Czech koruna, Norwegian krone, Swiss franc, Swedish krona, and Singapore dollar as the U.S. dollar's value reversed lower against these currencies during January on speculation that China, with a massive U.S. dollar reserve, would diversify some of its assets into other currencies. Additional losses in the currency markets were experienced during March from long positions in the Mexican peso versus the U.S. dollar as the value of the peso weakened on political uncertainty in Mexico, as well as during May from long positions in the Turkish lira and Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar as the value of these currencies declined sharply amid political uncertainty.

Additional losses of approximately 1.3% were experienced from long positions in wheat and corn futures during the second quarter as prices moved lower on favorable weather forecasts across the U.S. corn and wheat belts and reports from the U.S. Department of Agriculture showing improved crop conditions. Elsewhere in the agricultural complex, short positions in soybean meal futures recorded losses, also during the second quarter, as prices benefited from large volumes of speculative buying. Further losses were incurred from short positions in live cattle futures as prices reversed higher, during the second quarter, after news that South Korea would resume U.S. beef imports.
