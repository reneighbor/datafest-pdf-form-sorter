Hi John,
Thank you for your timely call back regarding the inquiry made to me in a January 19, 2012 letter signed by John C. Sassaman, Chief Counsel and Staff Director at the Select Committee on Ethics.
I am writing to confirm what I told you via telephone 30 minutes ago at 9:50 a.m. Hawaii time.
There was no earned income from the two organizations, Linda Lingle Trust and Republican Jewish Coalition, mentioned in the second page of the January 19, 2012 letter referenced above.
please feel free to contact me at anytime at this email address .-or at
Aloha, Linda Lingle
