Notes to "Improved Portfolio Efficiency":
Stocks are represented by the S&P 500 Index, corporate bonds are represented by the Citigroup Corporate Bond Index, and international equities are represented by the MSCI EAFE Index, each provided by PerTrac Financial Solutions, LLC, Memphis, TN; managed futures are represented by the Barclay CTA Index, provided by the Barclay Hedge Ltd., Fairfield, I A, Performance of any of these indices (which, by definition, are averages of many individual investments) may not be representative of any specific investment within that index's asset class.
The performance information of the asset classes above does not reflect the effect of fees identical to those to be paid by the partnerships, including management, incentive, and brokerage fees. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Note that while the Barclay CTA Index reflects results net of actual fees and expenses, it includes accounts with trading advisors and fee structures that differ from public managed futures funds (such as the partnerships). Also, the partnerships' trading strategies may be different from the trading strategies employed by the trading advisors included in the Barclay CTA Index. Accordingly, while the Barclay CTA Index is believed to be representative of managed futures in general, the performance of public managed futures funds as a subclass, or individually (in particular, the partnerships), may differ.
PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.
