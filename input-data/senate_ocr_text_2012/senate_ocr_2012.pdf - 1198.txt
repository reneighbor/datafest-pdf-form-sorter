systems is to identify positions in markets where the price action of a particular market signals the computerized systems used by Graham that a potential trend in prices is occurring. The systems are designed to mathematically analyze the recent trading characteristics of each market and statistically compare such characteristics to the long-term historical trading pattern of a particular market. As a result of this analysis, the programs will utilize proprietary risk management and trade filter strategies that are intended to enable the system to benefit from sustained price trends while protecting the account from unacceptable levels of risk and volatility exposure. One of the most important objectives of Graham's programs is to strategically reduce leverage in markets where it has achieved significant profits prior to substantial price reversal using proprietary techniques designed to reduce volatility, without diluting net returns. For a more detailed discussion of Graham and its various programs, see "The Trading Advisors—Morgan Stanley Charter Graham L.P." on pages 71 to 78.
Morgan Stanley Charter WCM L.P.
Winton employs a computerized, technical trend-following trading system developed by its principals. This system tracks the daily price movements from more than 100 futures and forward markets around the world, and carries out certain computations to determine each day how long or short the portfolio should be to maximize profit potential within a certain range of risk. For a more detailed discussion of Winton and its trading program, see "The Trading Advisors—Morgan Stanley Charter WCM L.P." on pages 79 to 86.
Morgan Stanley Charter Aspect L.P.
Aspect's investment philosophy involves a scientific approach to investment driven by Aspect's belief that market behavior is not random, but rather contains statistically measurable and predictable price movements and anomalies which, through sophisticated quantitative research and disciplined approach, can be successfully identified and exploited for profit. The trading program that Aspect uses to trade Charter Aspect's assets employs a fully-automated system to collect, process and analyze market data, including current and historical price data, and identify and exploit directional moves (or "trends") in market behavior, trading across a variety of frequencies to exploit trends over a range of timescales. Positions are taken according to the aggregate signal and are adjusted to control risk. For a more detailed discussion of Aspect and its trading program, see "The Trading Advisors—Morgan Stanley Charter Aspect L.P." on pages 87 to 95.
