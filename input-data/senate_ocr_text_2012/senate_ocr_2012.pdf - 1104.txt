(2)	reduce the Capital Account of a Partner other than in accordance with Article V of this Agreement, or
(3)	modify the events causing the dissolution of the Partnership, may be made only if (A) the written consent of each Partner adversely affected by the proposed action is obtained prior to the effectiveness of the action or (B) the amendment does not become effective until (i) each Limited Partner has received written notice of the amendment and (ii) any Limited Partner objecting to the amendment has been afforded a reasonable opportunity (under procedures prescribed by the General Partner in its sole discretion) to tender all of the Partner's Units for repurchase by the Partnership. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence or the provisions of Subsection 8.1(c), any amendment that would alter the provisions of Section 8.1 relating to the material amendment of this Agreement or the provisions of Section 3.8 of this Agreement relating to indemnification may be made only with the unanimous consent of the Partners and, to the extent required by the 1940 Act, approval of a majority of the Directors (and, if so required, a majority of the Independent Directors).
(c)	Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 8.1(a) and 8.1(b) of this Agreement, the General Partner, at any time without the consent of any other Partner, may:
(1)	restate this Agreement, together with any amendments to this Agreement that have been duly adopted in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement to incorporate the amendments in a single, integrated document;
(2)	amend this Agreement (other than with respect to the matters described in Section 8.1(b) of this Agreement) to change the name of the Partnership in accordance with Section 2.2 hereof or to effect compliance with any applicable law or regulation, including, but not limited to, to satisfy the requirements of applicable U.S. banking law or regulation, or to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision of this Agreement that may be inconsistent with any other provision of this Agreement, so long as the action does not adversely affect the rights of any Partner in any material respect; and
(3)	amend this Agreement to make any changes necessary or desirable, based on advice of legal counsel to the Partnership, to assure the Partnership's continuing eligibility to be classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a Partnership that is not treated as a corporation for tax purposes under the Code; subject, however, to the limitation that any material amendment to this Agreement under Section 8.1(c)(2) or (3) of this Agreement will be valid only if approved by a majority of the Directors (including the vote of a majority of the Independent Directors, if required by the 1940 Act).
(d)	The General Partner will give prior written notice of any proposed amendment to this Agreement (other than any amendment of the type contemplated by Section 8.1(c)(1) of this Agreement) to each Partner, which notice sets out (1) the text of the proposed amendment or (2) a summary of the amendment and a statement that the text of the amendment will be furnished to any Partner upon request.
