tax return may be subject to examination and adjustment by the Internal Revenue Service for a partnership item more than three years after it has been filed.
All of the foregoing statements are based upon the existing provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder and the existing administrative and judicial interpretations thereof. The general partner cannot assure you that legislative, administrative, or judicial changes will not occur which will modify such statements.
The foregoing statements are not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning, particularly since certain of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing units may not be the same for all taxpayers. The partnerships' tax returns could be audited by the Internal Revenue Service and adjustments to the returns could be made as a result of such audits. If an audit results in adjustment, limited partners may be required to file amended returns and their returns may be audited. Accordingly, prospective purchasers of units are urged to consult their tax advisers with specific reference to their own tax situation under federal law and the provisions of applicable state, local, and non-U.S. laws before subscribing for units.
STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAX ASPECTS
In addition to the U.S. federal income tax consequences for individuals described under "Material Federal Income Tax Considerations" above, the partnerships and their limited partners may be subject to various state and local taxes. Certain of these taxes could, if applicable, have a significant effect on the amount of tax payable in respect of an investment in the partnerships. A limited partner's distributive share of the realized profits of a partnership may be required to be included in determining his reportable income for state or local tax purposes. Furthermore, state and local tax laws may not reflect recent changes made to the U.S. federal income tax law and, therefore, may be inconsistent with the U.S. federal income treatment of gains and losses arising from the partnerships' transactions in Section 1256 contracts. Accordingly, prospective limited partners should consult with their own tax advisers concerning the applicability of state and local taxes to an investment in the partnerships.
The general partner has been advised by its legal counsel, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, that in such counsel's opinion, the partnerships should not be liable for New York City unincorporated business tax. Limited partners who are nonresidents of New York State will not be liable for New York State personal income tax on such partners' income from the partnerships, but may be liable for such tax to the extent such limited partners' allocable share of income attributable to the partnerships' transactions involves tangible personal property. Likewise, limited partners who are nonresidents of New York City will not be liable for New York City earnings tax on such partners' income from the partnerships. New York City residents may be subject to New York City personal income tax on the partners' income from the partnerships. No ruling from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance or the New York City Department of Finance has been, or will be, requested regarding such matters.
LEGAL MATTERS
Legal matters in connection with the units being offered hereby, including the discussion of the material federal income tax considerations relating to the acquisition, ownership, and disposition of units, have been passed upon for each partnership and the general partner by Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, One World Financial Center, New York, New York 10281. Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP also has acted as counsel for Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated in connection with the offering of units. Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP may advise the general partner with respect to its responsibilities as general partner of, and with respect to matters relating to, the partnerships.
