USE OF PROCEEDS
Substantially all of the proceeds from the sale of Units, net of the Core Alternatives Fund's and TEI Fund's fees and expenses, will be invested in the Master Fund by the Core Alternatives Fund, and in the Master Fund through the Offshore Fund by the TEI Fund, to pursue its investment program and objectives as soon as practicable, but in no event later than three months after receipt, consistent with market conditions and the availability of suitable investments.
DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS
General. Hatteras Capital Distributors, LLC (the "Distributor"), located at 8540 Colonnade Center Drive, Suite 401, Raleigh, North Carolina, acts as principal underwriter to the Funds on a best-efforts basis, subject to various conditions, pursuant to distribution services agreements between each Fund and the Distributor (together, the "Distribution Agreement"). Units in the Core Alternatives Fund and the TEI Fund are offered with a maximum sales charge of 2.00%. The Distributor is also responsible for selecting brokers and dealers in connection with the offering of Units and for negotiating the terms of any such arrangements. The Distributor is an affiliate of the Investment Manager and it also serves as the Master Fund's placement agent.
Neither the Distributor nor any other party is obligated to buy from the Funds any of the Units. There is no minimum aggregate amount of Units required to be purchased in any offering. In addition, the Distributor does not intend to make a market in the Units.
The General Partner, Investment Manager, Distributor and/or their affiliates may make payments to selected affiliated or unaffiliated third parties (including the parties who have entered into selling agreements with the Distributor) from time to time in connection with the distribution of Units and/or the servicing of Unit holders. These payments will be made out of the General Partner's, Investment Manager's, Distributor's and/or affiliates' own assets and will not represent an additional charge to a Fund. The amount of such payments may be significant in amount and the prospect of receiving any such payments may provide such third parties or their employees with an incentive to favor sales of Units in the Funds over other investment options. Contact your financial intermediary for details about revenue sharing payments it receives or may receive.
Pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, the Distributor is solely responsible for the costs and expenses incurred in connection with (i) its qualification as a broker-dealer under state or federal laws, and (ii) the advertising or promotion of the offering of the Units. The Distribution Agreement also provides that the Funds will indemnify the Distributor and its affiliates and certain other persons against certain liabilities, including certain liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Units in each Fund are available to investors investing through broker/dealers and other financial intermediaries where the financial intermediary and/or the Servicing Agent has agreed to provide certain administrative services.
Sales Charge. Investments in the Funds may be subject to a sales charge of up to 2.00%. The sales charge will be in addition to each Partner's purchase amount, and will not constitute part of a Partner's capital contribution to a Fund or part of the assets of such Fund. No sales charge or a reduced sales charge is expected to be charged with respect to investments by the Investment Manager and its affiliates, and their respective directors, principals, officers and employees and others in the Investment Manager's sole discretion. The full amount of the sales charge may be reallowed by the Distributor to brokers or dealers participating in the offering. Your financial intermediary may impose additional charges when you purchase Units of a Fund.
ADDITIONAL SALES OF UNITS. Each Fund currently intends to accept initial and additional subscriptions of Units as of the first business day of each calendar month or at such other times as may be determined by the General Partner. The General Partner may discontinue accepting subscriptions for Units at any time. Any amounts received in connection with a subscription for Units will be promptly placed in an escrow account with UMB Bank, N.A., as the Funds' escrow agent, prior to their investment in a Fund. Any interest earned on escrowed amounts will be credited to the Fund. All subscriptions for Units are subject to the receipt of cleared funds prior to the applicable purchase date in the full offering price. Although a Fund may accept, in its sole discretion, a subscription prior to receipt of cleared funds, a prospective Partner may not become a Partner until cleared funds have been received, and the prospective Partner is not entitled to interest or performance returns until accepted as a Partner. The prospective Partner must also submit a completed investor application before the applicable purchase date. Each Fund reserves the right to reject any offer to purchase Units and the Investment Manager may, in its sole discretion, suspend subscriptions for Units at any time and from time to time.
