SECTION 4.4 Transfer of Units of Limited Partners, (a) Any Units or portion of any Units held by a Limited Partner may be Transferred only (1) by operation of law pursuant to the death, bankruptcy, insolvency, adjudicated incompetence, or dissolution of the Limited Partner; or (2) under certain limited instances set out in this Agreement, with the written consent of the General Partner (which may be withheld in the General Partner's sole and absolute discretion). Unless the Partnership consults with legal counsel to the Partnership and counsel confirms that the Transfer will not cause the Partnership to be treated as a "publicly traded partnership" taxable as a corporation, however, the General Partner may not consent to a Transfer unless the following conditions are met: (i) the Transferring Limited Partner has been a Limited Partner for at least six months; (ii) the proposed Transfer is to be made on the effective date of an offer by the Partnership to repurchase Units; and (iii) the Transfer is (A) one in which the tax basis of the Units in the hands of the transferee is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to its tax basis in the hands of the Transferring Limited Partner (e.g., certain Transfers to affiliates, gifts and contributions to family entities), (B) to members of the Transferring Limited Partner's immediate family (siblings, spouse, parents and children), or (C) a distribution from a qualified retirement plan or an individual retirement account. In addition, the General Partner may not consent to a Transfer unless the Person to whom or which Units are Transferred (or each of the Person's equity owners if the Person is a "private investment company" as defined in Rule 205-3(d)(3) under the Advisers Act, an investment company registered under the 1940 Act, or a business development company as defined under the Advisers Act) is a Person whom or which the General Partner believes meets the requirements of paragraph (d)(1) of Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act or successor provision of any of those rules, or is otherwise exempt from the requirements of those rules. In the event that other investor eligibility requirements are established by the Partnership, the Person to whom or which Units are Transferred must satisfy these other requirements. If any transferee does not meet the investor eligibility requirements described in this Section 4.4(a), the General Partner may not consent to the Transfer. In addition, no Limited Partner will be permitted to Transfer his, her or its Units unless after the Transfer the balance of the Capital Account of the transferee, and of the Limited Partner Transferring less than all of such Partner's Units, is at least equal to the amount of the Limited Partner's initial Capital Contribution. Any permitted transferee will be entitled to the allocations and distributions allocable to the Units so acquired and to Transfer the Units in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, but will not be entitled to the other rights of a Limited Partner unless and until the transferee becomes a substituted Limited Partner. If a Limited Partner Transfers Units with the approval of the General Partner, the General Partner will promptly take all necessary actions so that each transferee or successor to whom or to which the Units are Transferred is admitted to the Partnership as a Limited Partner. The admission of any transferee as a substituted Limited Partner will be effective upon the execution and delivery by, or on behalf of, the substituted Limited Partner of this Agreement or an instrument that constitutes the execution and delivery of this Agreement. Each Limited Partner and transferee agrees to pay all expenses, including attorneys' and accountants' fees, incurred by the Partnership in connection with any Transfer. In connection with any request to Transfer Units, the Partnership may require the Limited Partner requesting the Transfer to obtain, at the Limited Partner's expense, an opinion of counsel selected by the General Partner as to such
