not Section 1256 contracts of the type described in the preceding sentence and if a partnership is otherwise eligible, the general partner may elect to have a partnership be treated as a qualified fund. Each partnership has made such an election. Pursuant to this election, each partnership intends to treat gain or loss with respect to substantially all of the partnership's transactions with a foreign currency component (other than foreign currency contracts which are Section 1256 contracts) as short-term capital gain or loss, and the contracts themselves as subject to the mark-to-market system of taxation. It is possible that the Internal Revenue Service might assert that certain of these contracts should be taken into account for tax purposes only when realized. If a partnership so elects but fails to meet the requirements of electing qualified fund status in a taxable year, (i) a net loss recognized by the partnership in such taxable year with respect to all forward contracts, futures contracts and options with respect to foreign currency trades by the partnership will be characterized as a capital loss, and (ii) a net gain recognized by the partnership in such taxable year with respect to certain contracts will be characterized as ordinary income.
Taxation of Limited Partners
Limitations on Deductibility of Partnership Losses. The amount of partnership loss, including capital loss, which a limited partner will be entitled to take into account for U.S. federal income tax purposes is limited to the tax basis of his units, except in the case of certain limited partners including individuals and closely-held C corporations, for which he is "at risk" with respect to the units as of the end of the partnership's taxable year in which such loss occurred.
Generally, a limited partner's initial tax basis will be the amount paid for each unit. A limited partner's adjusted tax basis will be his initial tax basis reduced by the limited partner's share of partnership distributions, losses, and expenses and increased by his share of partnership income and gains. The amount for which a limited partner is "at risk" with respect to his units in a partnership is generally equal to his tax basis for the units, less; any amounts borrowed in connection with his acquisition of the units for which he is not personally liable and for which he has pledged no property other than his units; any amounts borrowed from persons who have a proprietary interest in the partnership; and any amounts borrowed for which the limited partner is protected against loss through guarantees or similar arrangements.
Because of the limitations imposed upon the deductibility of capital losses referred to below, a limited partner's share of a partnership's net capital losses, if any, will not materially reduce his U.S. federal income tax on his ordinary income. In addition, certain expenses of a partnership might be deductible by a limited partner only as itemized deductions and, therefore, will not reduce the U.S. federal taxable income of a limited partner who does not itemize his deductions. Furthermore, an individual who is subject to the alternative minimum tax for a taxable year may not realize any tax benefit from such itemized deductions.
Limitations on Deductibility of Passive Losses. The partnerships' income will not be treated as a "passive activity" for purposes of the limitation on the deduction of passive activity losses.
Limited Deduction of Certain Expenses. Certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as expenses incurred to maintain property held for investment, are deductible only to the extent that they exceed 2% of the adjusted gross income of an individual, trust, or estate. The amount of certain itemized deductions allowable to individuals is further reduced by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 3% of the individual's adjusted gross income in excess of a certain threshold amount and (ii) 80% of such itemized deductions. This further limitation on itemized deductions is reduced for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2005 and before January 1, 2010, and does not apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009 and before January 1, 2011. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2010, this limitation is again applicable, without reduction. Moreover, such investment expenses are miscellaneous itemized deductions that are not deductible by a non-corporate taxpayer in calculating its alternative minimum tax liability. Based upon the current and contemplated activities of the partnerships, the general partner has
