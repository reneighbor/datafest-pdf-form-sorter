$2 in April, a "peak-to-valley drawdown" analysis conducted as of the end of April would consider that "drawdown" to be still continuing and to be $3 in amount because the $15 initial month-end net asset value per unit had not been equaled or exceeded by a subsequent month-end net asset value per unit, whereas if the net asset value of a unit had increased by $2 in March, the January-February drawdown would have ended as of the end of February at the $2 level because the $15 initial net asset value per unit would have been equaled in March. Such "drawdowns" are measured on the basis of month-end net asset values only, and do not reflect intra-month figures.
"Monthly Performance" is the percentage change in net asset value per unit from one month to another.
"Compound Annual/Period Rate of Return" is calculated by multiplying on a compound basis each of the monthly rates of return and not by adding or averaging such monthly rates of return. For periods of less than one year, the results are year-to-date.
