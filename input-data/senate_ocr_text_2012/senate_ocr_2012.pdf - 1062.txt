plural in commodities of a kind customarily dealt in on an organized exchange in transactions of a kind customarily consummated there), and (3) any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. Federal income tax purposes in which the Master Fund invests is not deemed to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business.
With respect to (3) above, the Offshore Fund has no control over whether entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which the Master Fund invests are engaged or deemed to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business. However, the Master Fund intends to use reasonable efforts to reduce or eliminate the extent to which it allocates investment assets to entities treated as partnerships for U.S. Federal income tax purposes that are engaged or deemed to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business.
In the event that the Master Fund were found to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business, the Offshore Fund would be required to file a U.S. Federal income tax return for such year on IRS Form 1120-F and pay tax at full U.S. corporate income tax rates on the portion of its income that is treated as effectively connected with such U.S. trade or business, and an additional 30% branch profits tax would be imposed under Section 884 of the Code on profits deemed repatriated from the United States. In addition, in such event, the Master Fund would be required under Section 1446 of the Code to withhold taxes with respect to the "effectively connected" income or gain allocable to the Offshore Fund (which withholding taxes would be applied toward the Offshore Fund's tax liabilities).
Assuming that the Master Fund is not engaged in a U.S. trade or business, the Offshore Fund will be subject to withholding of Federal income tax at a 30% rate on its allocable share of the Master Fund's U.S.-source dividend income and other U.S.-source fixed or determinable annual or periodic gains, profits, or income as defined in Section 881(a) of the Code other than most forms of interest income. The Master Fund will also generally not qualify for any tax treaty benefits with respect to the Offshore Fund's allocable shares of dividends, interest and gains on securities that are subject to foreign withholding taxes.
The Offshore Fund does not expect to maintain significant cash reserves, but generally intend to invest any cash reserves that may exist in a manner so as not to be subject to 30% withholding.
Legislation has been introduced that would treat certain offshore corporations that are managed or controlled in the United States as U.S. corporations for federal income tax purposes. If this legislation were to pass, the Offshore Fund would be subject to U.S. federal income tax.
INVESTORS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISERS WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIFIC FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, U.S. AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PURCHASE AND OWNERSHIP OF AN INTEREST IN THE FUND AND/OR THE FILING REQUIREMENTS, IF ANY, ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE AND OWNERSHIP OF AN INTEREST IN THE FUND.
Investment by Tax-Qualified Retirement Plans and other Tax-Exempt Investors
Tax-qualified pension and profit-sharing plans (including Keogh or HR-10 plans), traditional and Roth individual retirement accounts described in Sections 408 and 403A of the Code, respectively ("IRAs"), educational institutions, and other investors exempt from taxation under Section 501 of the Code are generally exempt from Federal income tax except to the extent that they recognize UBTI. UBTI is income from an unrelated trade or business regularly carried on, excluding various types of investment such as dividends, interest, certain rental income, and capital gain, so long as not derived from debt-financed property. If a tax-exempt organization is a partner in a partnership that generates UBTI, the UBTI of the partnership will pass through to the organization. In addition, UBTI includes income derived from debt-financed property, i.e., property as to which there is "acquisition indebtedness". Acquisition indebtedness is the unpaid amount of any debt incurred directly or indirectly to acquire or improve the property. During the period that any acquisition indebtedness is outstanding, a pro rata share of the income from the property will generally be UBTI based on the ratio of the average outstanding principal balance of the debt to the average tax basis of the property during the applicable tax year. To the extent the Master Fund holds debt-financed property or property primarily for sale to customers or becomes actively involved in trading securities, income attributable to such property or activity could constitute UBTI to a direct investor in the Master Fund. But, no such UBTI from the Master Fund should be attributable to a shareholder of the Offshore Fund or an investor in the TEI Fund, because UBTI generally should not pass through a corporation such as the Offshore Fund to its U.S. direct or indirect tax-exempt investors.
Because all shares of the Offshore Fund will be owned by the TEI Fund, which is a U.S. person for Federal income tax purposes, the Offshore Fund will be considered a controlled foreign corporation ("CFC") for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. Income of a CFC is taxable as UBTI to a tax-exempt entity only if the income consists of certain kinds of insurance income as defined in Section 512(b)(17) of the Code. The Offshore Fund does not expect to generate UBTI of this type. Accordingly, the TEI Fund believes that income of the TEI Fund allocable to tax-exempt investors should not constitute UBTI.
