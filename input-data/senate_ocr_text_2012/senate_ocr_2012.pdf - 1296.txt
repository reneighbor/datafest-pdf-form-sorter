CFTC requires each U.S. exchange to submit position limits for commodities traded on such exchange for approval by the CFTC. However, position limits do not apply to some futures contracts. Position limits do not apply to forward contract trading or generally to trading on non-U.S. commodity exchanges. See "Risk Factors — Trading and Performance Risks — The partnerships are subject to speculative position limits" on page 14.
Daily Limits
Most U.S. futures exchanges (but generally not foreign exchanges or banks or dealers in the case of forward contracts) limit the amount of fluctuation in futures or options contract prices during a single trading day by regulation. These regulations specify what are referred to as "daily price fluctuation limits" or more commonly "daily limits." The daily limits establish the maximum amount that the price of a futures or options contract may vary either up or down from the previous day's settlement price. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular futures or options market, no trades may be made at a price beyond the limit. See "Risk Factors — Trading and Peiformance Risks — Market illiquidity may cause less favorable trade prices" on page 13.
Regulations
Futures exchanges in the U.S. are subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act by the CFTC, the governmental agency having responsibility for regulation of futures exchanges and trading on those exchanges.
The CFTC also regulates the activities of "commodity trading advisors" and "commodity pool operators" and has adopted regulations with respect to certain of such persons' activities. The CFTC requires a commodity pool operator (such as the general partner) to keep accurate, current, and orderly records with respect to each pool it operates. The CFTC may suspend the registration of a commodity pool operator if the CFTC finds that the operator has violated the Commodity Exchange Act or regulations thereunder and in certain other circumstances. Suspension, restriction, or termination of the general partner's registration as a commodity pool operator would prevent it, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, from managing, and might result in the termination of, the partnerships. The Commodity Exchange Act gives the CFTC similar authority with respect to the activities of commodity trading advisors, such as the trading advisors. If the registration of a trading advisor as a commodity trading advisor were to be terminated, restricted, or suspended, the trading advisor would be unable, until such time (if any) as such registration were to be reinstated, to render trading advice to the relevant partnership. The partnerships themselves are not registered with the CFTC in any capacity.
The Commodity Exchange Act requires all "futures commission merchants," such as Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, to meet and maintain specified fitness and financial requirements, to segregate customer funds from proprietary funds and account separately for all customers' funds and positions, and to maintain specified books and records open to inspection by the staff of the CFTC. The partnerships have no present intention of using any introducing brokers in their trading.
The Commodity Exchange Act also gives the states certain powers to enforce its provisions and the regulations of the CFTC.
You are afforded certain rights for reparations under the Commodity Exchange Act. You may also be able to maintain a private right of action for certain violations of the Commodity Exchange Act. The CFTC has adopted rules implementing the reparation provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act which provide that any person may file a complaint for a reparations award with the CFTC for violation of the Commodity Exchange Act against a floor broker, futures commission merchant, introducing broker, commodity trading advisor, commodity pool operator, and their respective associated persons.
