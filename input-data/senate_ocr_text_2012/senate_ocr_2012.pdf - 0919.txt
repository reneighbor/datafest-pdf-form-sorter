Item 4 - Advisory Business
Our firm is organized as a Delaware limited partnership and is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, a publicly traded company. Its general partner is Morgan Stanley Alternative Investments LLC ("MSAI") and its limited partner is Morgan Stanley Investment Management Inc. ("MSIM"). Each of MSAI and MSIM is wholly owned by Morgan Stanley. We have been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission since 2001.
In General: Our advisory business consists primarily of identifying investment opportunities and making investments in diversified portfolios of traditional and non-traditional investment funds. Advisory services of this nature are provided to Funds (as defined below) and separate accounts (together referred to herein as the "Accounts") on a discretionary and non-discretionary basis. When we use the term "Funds" in this Brochure, it refers to both pooled investment vehicles and those entities that are established as investment vehicles for a single account or investor. The underlying funds in which we invest are referred to throughout this Brochure as the "Investment Funds" and the third party investment managers who manage the Investment Funds are referred to as the "Investment Managers".
In addition to providing advisory services to the Funds as described above, we may also act as the adviser of certain other funds (or other similar vehicles) that are established to invest alongside the Funds described above or underlying private equity funds in connection with a specific investment (collectively, the "Co-Investment Partnerships").
Our advisory business focuses on three fund of funds strategies: (1) fund of hedge funds; (2) private equity fund of funds; and (3) private equity real estate fund of funds.
Fund of Hedge Funds: Our fund of hedge funds investment process consists of investing in hedge funds managed by Investment Managers who employ a variety of non-traditional liquid market investment strategies and certain investment funds managed in a traditional style. In addition, certain of the fund of hedge funds Accounts may make investments directly in privately held companies or publicly traded companies in which an Account invests alongside an Investment Fund, typically an Investment Fund in which the Account invests directly ("Co-Investment") as part of its investment strategy or make investments in secondary market purchases of interests in hedge funds.
Private Equity Fund of Funds: For our private equity funds of funds strategies, we implement our investment advice through three primary investment approaches: (a) primary commitments to Investment Funds; (b) Co-Investments, primarily alongside our existing Investment Managers; and (c) secondary market purchases of interests in existing private equity funds.
Private Equity Real Estate Fund of Funds: For our private equity real estate fund of funds strategy, we generally implement investment advice through: (i) primary commitments to Investment Funds; (ii) Co-Investments; (iii) secondary market purchases of interests in existing private equity real estate funds; and (iv) investments in managers transitioning to real estate fund management from real estate management, ownership and/or
