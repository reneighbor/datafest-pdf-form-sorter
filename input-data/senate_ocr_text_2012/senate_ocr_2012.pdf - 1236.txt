Introduction to Trading Advisor Descriptions
The biographies of the principals and brief summaries of the trading programs of the trading advisor for each partnership are set forth below. The success of each partnership is dependent upon the success of its trading advisor. However, in evaluating these descriptions, an investor should be aware that each trading advisor's trading methods are proprietary and confidential, the trading advisor selected for a partnership may change, and even if the same trading advisor continues to trade for a partnership it may make substantial modifications to its trading programs. Investors will generally not be made aware of when a trading advisor makes a modification to its trading program.
