You do not need to decide which method is better for you when you apply for retirement. ETF calculates your benefit both ways and automatically pays the higher amount Under both methods, any gain or loss from Variable Fund participation and any additional contributions you have are reflected In the benefit computation.

Accelerated Payment Options
Accelerated payment options are normally available if your retirement annuity begins before age 62. Your For Annuitant's Life Only after-age 62 option amount must meet the annual monthly minimum amount. They are available in the same options as described above, but they include an accelerated payment provision. You would receive a higher temporary monthly WRS annuity until age 62 than you would receive under a regular option.
At age 62, when you are eligible to apply for regular Social Security, your WRS annuity decreases because the temporary accelerated portion ends. The accelerated payment options are intended to provide you with about the same income from the WRS alone that you may receive from the WRS and Social Security combined after age 62.
If you die while receiving an accelerated payment option that began after June 30, 2008, the temporary accelerated portion is paid as a death benefit until you would have reached age 62. For accelerated annuities that began before July 1, 2008, the accelerated portion ends at death. Any death benefit is based on only the after-age-62 amount payable to your beneficiary(ies) or named survivor. Under the Reduced 25% on Death of Annuitant or Named Survivor option, the after-age-62 amount (permanent portion) of your annuity reduces if your named survivor dies first. Your temporary portion does not change.
ETF has no connection with the Social Security Administration. We base the estimated Social Security amount in our calculations on tables that assume an entire career of employment (30 or more years) covered under Social Security. This amount may be much different than your actual Social Security amount at age 62.
