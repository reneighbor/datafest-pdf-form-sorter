EXCHANGE RIGHT
If the conditions described below are satisfied, you may redeem your units in any partnership as of the last day of any calendar month and use the proceeds to purchase units of any of the other Charter Series partnerships. However, a Charter Series exchange will only be permitted as of the sixth month-end after you first became an investor in a Charter Series partnership, and as of the last day of each month thereafter. Each unit you purchase in a Charter Series exchange will be issued and sold at a price per unit equal to 100% of the net asset value of a unit as of the close of business on the exchange date. Any units you redeem in a Charter Series exchange will not be subject to a redemption charge. Units you acquire in a Charter Series exchange will be subject to redemption charges, but will be deemed to have the same purchase date as the units you exchanged for purposes of determining the applicability of any redemption charges. Thus, for example, if you hold units of Charter Graham for twelve months, exchange those units for units of Charter WCM, then redeem any of those units fifteen months later, you will not have to pay a redemption charge, because those units will be deemed to have been held for 27 months.
When you request a Charter Series exchange, additional conditions must be satisfied. First, the partnership from which you are redeeming must have assets sufficient to discharge its liabilities and redeem units. In order to effect a Charter Series exchange, you must send a subscription and exchange agreement to a Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated branch office, and that agreement must be forwarded by the branch office and received by the general partner by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the applicable exchange date. In that agreement you must acknowledge that you are still eligible to purchase units on the exchange date. You must exchange a minimum of 100 units in a Charter Series exchange, unless you are liquidating your entire interest in a partnership. A form of subscription and exchange agreement is annexed to this prospectus as Exhibit B, and additional copies of the subscription and exchange agreement may be obtained by written request to the general partner or from a local Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporate4 branch office.
In order to effect a Charter Series exchange, each partnership must have a sufficient number of units registered and qualified for sale under federal and applicable state securities laws pursuant to a current prospectus. While each partnership currently has a sufficient number of registered units to effect series exchanges, it is under no obligation to do so. Therefore, the general partner cannot assure you that any units will be available for sale on an exchange date. Furthermore, states may impose significant burdens on, or alter the requirements for, qualifying units for sale. In that event, the general partner may not continue qualifying units for sale in those states, and residents of those states would not be eligible for a Charter Series exchange. In addition, certain states may impose more restrictive suitability and/or investment requirements than those set forth in the form of subscription and exchange agreement. Any such restrictions may limit the ability of residents of those states to effect a Charter Series exchange. In the event that not all subscription and exchange agreements can be processed because an insufficient number of units is available for sale on an exchange date, the general partner will allocate units in a manner it determines in its sole discretion. The general partner has not yet determined how it will allocate units in the event there are an insufficient number of units available on an exchange date.
Units of any new partnership in the Charter Series may be offered to investors pursuant to exercise of the Charter Series exchange right. Before purchasing units of a new partnership, you will be required to receive a copy of a prospectus and any supplement to this prospectus describing the new partnership and its units, and you will be required to execute a new subscription agreement to purchase units of that partnership.
Since a Charter Series exchange is equivalent to a redemption and an immediate reinvestment of the proceeds of the redemption, you should carefully review the portions of this prospectus describing redemptions and the tax consequences before effecting a Charter Series exchange.
