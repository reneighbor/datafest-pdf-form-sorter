Investing for Accounts:
Conflicts of interest may arise for us in connection with certain transactions involving investments by certain of our Accounts in Investment Funds and investments by other Accounts advised by us, or sponsored or managed by Morgan Stanley, in the same Investment Funds. Conflicts of interest may also arise in connection with investments in certain Funds by other Funds advised or managed by us or any of our affiliates. Such conflicts could arise, for example, with respect to the timing, structuring and terms of such investments and the disposition of them. We (or our affiliate) may determine that an investment in an Investment Fund is appropriate for a particular client or for us or our officers, directors, principals, members or employees, but that such investment is not appropriate for certain of our other Funds. Situations also may arise in which we, one of our affiliates, or the clients of either, have made investments that would have been suitable for investment by certain of our Funds but, for various reasons, were not pursued by, or available to, such Funds. Our investment activities, our affiliates and any of the respective officers, directors, principals, members or employees may disadvantage some certain Funds in some situations if, among other reasons, the investment activities limit a Fund's ability to invest in a particular Investment Fund.
We recommend that clients invest in Funds for which we act as investment adviser. Prior to subscribing for interests in a Fund advised by us, investors receive information relating to potential conflicts of interest between the activities of the Fund and our business activities, and those of our affiliates, or clients that may have a financial interest in the securities in which the Fund invests.
From time to time, we may manage an Account that contains Morgan Stanley "seed capital" and in those instances we may buy Investment Funds for the seed capital account along with our other Accounts. This may present a conflict of interest if an Investment Fund has limited investment capacity and is unable to accommodate our investment in the amount we request for all applicable Accounts. In order to ensure that each Account is treated in a fair and equitable manner, we have adopted trade allocation procedures trade procedures that we believe are reasonably designed to address these and other conflicts of interest.
