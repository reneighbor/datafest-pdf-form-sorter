REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Limited Partners and the General Partner of Morgan Stanley Charter Campbell L.P., Morgan Stanley Charter Aspect L.P., Morgan Stanley Charter Graham L.P., and Morgan Stanley Charter WCM L.P,:
We have audited the accompanying statements of financial condition of Morgan Stanley Charter Campbell L.P., Morgan Stanley Charter Aspect L.P., Morgan Stanley Charter Graham L.P., and Morgan Stanley Charter WCM L.P. (collectively, the "Partnerships"), including the schedules of investments, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related statements of operations, changes in partners' capital, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnerships' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Morgan Stanley Charter Campbell L.P., Morgan Stanley Charter Aspect L.P., Morgan Stanley Charter Graham L.P., and Morgan Stanley Charter WCM L.P. at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of their operations, changes in partners' capital, and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 1, the Partnerships modified their classification of cash within the statements of financial condition and cash flows and modified their presentation of options within the statements of financial condition to conform to 2007 presentation.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Partnerships' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 20, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Partnerships' internal control over financial reporting.
