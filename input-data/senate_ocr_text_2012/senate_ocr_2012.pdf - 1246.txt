Principals
David Harding, born in 1961, founded Winton Capital Management Limited in February 1997. Having graduated from Cambridge University with a First Class Honors Degree, he began his career in the financial industry in 1982. Between September 1982 and December 1984, he held various positions as a UK Gilt trader and salesman at two UK stockbrokers: Wood MacKenzie and Johnson Matthey & Wallace. He then joined Sabre Fund Management Ltd, a London based commodity trading advisor, as an assistant technical trader and researcher, and was later promoted to Director of Research. In December 1986, he moved to Brockham Securities Ltd, a privately owned sugar trading and managed futures company, to assist in the development and marketing of the firm's futures fund management services.
In February 1987, he left Brockham and, together with colleagues Michael Adam and Martin Lueck, founded Adam, Harding and Lueck Ltd., a computer-driven, research-based commodity trading advisor. Adam, Harding and Lueck became registered with the CFTC in February 1987. By 1989, this firm had grown into the UK's largest commodity trading advisor, with more than $50 million under management. At that time, the principals sold a 51% stake to E D & F Man Group Ltd., one of the largest distributors of futures funds internationally.
Between 1989 and 1993, when assets under management rose to $300 million, Mr. Harding headed up Adam, Harding and Lueck's quantitative research team, supervising about 15 full-time research staff, supported by a software team of around a dozen programmers. This team developed a multiplicity of quantitative trading strategies in addition to Adam, Harding and Lueck's successful trend-following trading approach. Dining this time, he was also involved in the company's international institutional marketing efforts, in particular in Europe, the Middle East, South East Asia, Japan and the U.S.
In September 1994, E D & F Man Group Ltd. bought out the minority shares owned by Mr. Harding and the original partners, and Adam, Harding and Lueck was consolidated into E D & F Man Group Ltd.'s fund management division. Mr. Harding then formed and headed up a new division of E D & F Man Ltd., called E D & F Man Quantitative Research, leading a research team that developed quantitative trading models primarily for use by E D & F Man Ltd.'s fund management companies. Mr. Harding left E D & F Man Ltd. in August 1996 and in February 1997 founded Winton together with Martin Hunt and Osman Murgian. Winton's founding principle is the belief that robust statistical research provides the richest and most reliable source of information on market behavior. Research has always constituted the largest area of investment in the company, which remains private and tightly controlled, employing around 150 people. In 2005, Winton set up a research campus in the Oxford Science Park to better pursue its mission of long term scientific research. In July 2007, Winton opened a second research campus in Hammersmith. The company currently employs over 80 researchers with PhDs and Masters degrees in such diverse fields as: operations research, statistics, actuarial science, extragalactic astrophysics and financial mathematics, with a distinct focus on practical application.
Osman Murgian is a founding director and a principal of Winton. Educated in Brighton College in England, Mr. Murgian was also one of the original shareholders and directors of Adam, Harding and Lueck Ltd. Mr. Murgian lives in Nairobi, Kenya, and is the owner of or an investor in a number of international businesses ranging from real estate to transportation. Mr. Murgian has a beneficial interest of more than 10% of Winton's share capital. This interest is held by Samur (Jersey) Ltd. and Amur (Jersey) Ltd. both of which are investment holding companies owned by Mr. Murgian's family foundation.
