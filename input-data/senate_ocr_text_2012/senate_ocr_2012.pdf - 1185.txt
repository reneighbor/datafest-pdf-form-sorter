Incorporated or other affiliates of the general partner. In connection with this conflict of interest, you should understand that Morgan Stanley & Co.

None of these expenses would ordinarily be paid by an independent commodity broker, and these expenses would otherwise have to be borne by the partnerships. Further, the general partner provides ongoing services to the partnerships, including administering the redemption and exchanges of units, and the general partner has financial obligations as the general partner of the partnerships. The general partner is not reimbursed or otherwise compensated by the partnerships for these services or obligations.
