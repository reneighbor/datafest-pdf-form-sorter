of securities, or the overall market. Advisers that manage Long/Short Public Equity Adviser Funds generally derive performance by establishing offsetting positions (a "long" and "short" position) based on perceived disparities in the relative values of the positions or portfolio of positions. Unlike "long only" managers, Long/Short Public Equity Advisers will almost always have "short" positions in stocks, and may also use a variety of other tools designed to enhance performance (e.g., leverage), mitigate risk and/or protect profits (e.g., market "puts" and "calls," etc.). An Adviser within the strategy may run a net "long" position; provided, however, that the net "long" position will typically be less than those included in the traditional "long" equity portfolio.
Investments may represent short-term trading opportunities or a longer-term fundamental judgment on the relative performance of a security. The Investment Manager believes key capabilities in long/short equity investing are in-depth fundamental and regulatory analysis, industry experience, and/or valuation and financial modeling. It is important to note that an Adviser may employ all or a portion of these capabilities in constructing its portfolio. There can be no assurance that any such hedging techniques will be successful or that the hedging employed by the Adviser will not have the negative effect of lowering overall returns, or creating losses, in the portfolio or with respect to the applicable position.
The Sector Specialist strategy involves investing in companies in specific market sectors, such as the financial, technology, healthcare, real estate, energy or natural resource sectors.
ENHANCED FIXED INCOME
•	High Yield Debt
•	Distressed Securities
•	Structured Credit
•	Opportunistic Credit
The Enhanced Fixed Income investment strategy seeks to provide superior risk-adjusted investment performance by focusing on less efficient areas of the global fixed income markets (including certain sectors of the U.S. fixed income markets). In general, this investment strategy encompasses High Yield Debt, Distressed Securities, Structured Credit and Opportunistic Credit investing (including, among other things, in emerging markets). To achieve an appropriately broad allocation of investments, the Master Fund may employ more than one Adviser in each Enhanced Fixed Income investment strategy, with the objective of gaining diversification in geography (to minimize the economic or currency risk of a particular country or region), credit quality, issuers, industrial segment and/or other factors important to generate a broad portfolio. It is important to note that some or all of these factors may not be included in the construction of this portion of the portfolio.
The High Yield Debt strategy involves investing predominantly in the debt of financially troubled, or stressed, companies. These companies are generally experiencing financial difficulties that have either led to a default on their indebtedness or increased the likelihood of default. A default may be related to missing a payment of interest or principal when due ("payment default"), which is generally considered a major default, or more minor events of default, such as breaking a financial ratio (e.g., if the debt instrument requires a 2:1 cash flow to debt payment ratio, having a ratio of less than 2:1). These more minor events of default may be waived by the creditor (generally the trustee of the bond issuance), but evidence an increased likelihood that the issuer will not be able to pay the indebtedness when due. Thus, in the event that a company is experiencing financial difficulties (which is generally the case), the Investment Manager believes it is important to determine the following: (1) the capital structure of the company (particularly debt that is senior to the debt issuance being considered); (2) the asset base of the company (what would be realized in a distressed liquidation mode that is generally less than what the assets would be worth in a more orderly disposition); and (3) whether this liquidation covers senior obligations and generates sufficient proceeds to repay the debt instrument being purchased. This would represent the liquidation value of the company and give the High Yield Debt Adviser the "downside" case. In addition, the High Yield Debt Adviser would typically analyze the company to determine the ability of the company to correct any operational difficulties, weather a recession or downturn in its industry or otherwise return to operational health. This requires strong fundamental analysis to determine the company's current health, its prospects for returning to financial health based on current trends or management plans, and the current and prospective operational and economic environment ("fundamental analysis"). In other contexts, a high yield instrument may be one that is issued by a company that still is an investment grade company (but typically in the lower end of investment grade) but may have a specific contingent liability clouding its horizon (e.g., underfunded pension obligations), be in an industry that is experiencing significant turmoil or is in a troubled region of the world, etc. Thus, the Investment Manager believes a critical aspect of investing in high yield fixed income instruments is analyzing these type and other types of exogenous events. High Yield Debt Advisers will generally consider, among other factors, the price of the security, the prospects of the issuer, the company's history, management and current conditions when making investment decisions. It is important to note that some or all of these factors may not be included in the construction of this portion of the portfolio. Investments may involve both U.S. and non-U.S. entities and may utilize leverage.
