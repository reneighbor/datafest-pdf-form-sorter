Certain prospective Plan investors may currently maintain relationships with the Investment Manager or one or more investment advisers of Adviser Funds in which the Master Fund will invest, or with other entities that are affiliated with the Investment Manager or such investment advisers. Each of such persons may be deemed to be a "party in interest" (as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA) or a "disqualified person" (as defined in Section 4975 of the Code) with respect to, and/or a fiduciary of, any Plan to which it (or an affiliate) provides investment management, investment advisory, or other services. ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Plan assets from being used for the benefit of a party in interest or disqualified person and also prohibit a Plan Fiduciary from using its fiduciary authority, control or responsibility to cause the Plan to make an investment from which it or certain third parties in which such Plan Fiduciary has an interest would receive a fee or other consideration. Plan investors should consult with legal counsel to determine if participation in the TEI Fund is a transaction that is prohibited by ERISA or the Code, and will be required to represent that the purchase of Units in the TEI Fund is not such a prohibited transaction. Plan Fiduciaries also will be required to represent that the decision to invest in the TEI Fund was made by them as fiduciaries that are independent of such affiliated persons, that are duly authorized to make such investment decisions, and that have not relied on any individualized advice or recommendation of such affiliated persons as a primary basis for the decision to invest in the TEI Fund.
The foregoing statements regarding the consequences under ERISA and the Code of an investment in the TEI Fund are based on the provisions of the Code and ERISA as in effect on April 1, 2011, and the then-existing administrative and judicial interpretations thereunder. No assurance can be given that administrative, judicial, or legislative changes will not occur that will not make the foregoing statements incorrect or incomplete.
ACCEPTANCE OF SUBSCRIPTIONS ON BEHALF OF PLANS IS IN NO RESPECT A REPRESENTATION BY THE BOARD, THE INVESTMENT MANAGER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY RELATED TO THE FUND THAT THIS INVESTMENT MEETS THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO INVESTMENTS BY ANY PARTICULAR PLAN OR THAT THIS INVESTMENT IS APPROPRIATE FOR ANY PARTICULAR PLAN. THE PERSON WITH THE INVESTMENT DISCRETION SHOULD CONSULT WITH HIS OR HER ATTORNEY AND FINANCIAL ADVISERS AS TO THE PROPRIETY OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND IN LIGHT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTICULAR PLAN.
