Partnership and Offering Risks
Each partnership incurs substantial charges. Each partnership incurs substantial charges and must earn significant trading profits just to pay those expenses. We estimate the percentage of partnership net assets that must be earned each year in order for each partnership to break even without accounting for a redemption charge to be:
For actual past performance results relating to each partnership, including when a partnership did not break even, see each partnership's performance capsule on pages 34 to 37,
Incentive fees may be paid by a partnership even though the partnership sustains trading losses. Each partnership pays its trading advisor an incentive fee based upon partnership trading profits. These trading profits include unrealized appreciation on open positions. Accordingly, it is possible that a partnership will pay an incentive fee on trading profits that do not become realized. Also, each trading advisor will retain all incentive fees paid to it, even if the partnership managed by the trading advisor incurs a subsequent loss after payment of an incentive fee. Because incentive fees are paid monthly for each partnership, it is possible that an incentive fee may be paid to a trading advisor during a year in which the partnership suffers a loss for the year. Because each trading advisor for a partnership receives an incentive fee based on the trading profits earned by the partnership, the trading advisor may have an incentive to make investments that are riskier than would be the case in the absence of such an incentive fee. In the case of each of Charter WCM and Charter Aspect, each partnership pays incentive fees based upon the performance of its new trading advisor, effective December 1, 2006, without regard to any losses incurred by the prior trading advisor.
Restricted investment liquidity in the units. There is no secondary market for units and you are not permitted to redeem your units until you have been an investor in the Charter Series of partnerships for at least six months. After the initial six-month period, you may redeem your units at any month-end, but you may have to pay a redemption charge if you redeem units during the first twenty-four months after they were purchased. Your right to receive payment on a redemption is not absolute and is dependent upon the partnership having sufficient assets to pay its liabilities on the redemption date, and the general partner receiving your request for redemption no later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of the applicable monthly closing.
The general partner will not permit a transfer or assignment of units unless it is satisfied that the transfer or assignment would not be in violation of Delaware law or applicable federal, state, or non-U.S. securities laws and notwithstanding any transfer or assignment, the partnership will continue to be classified as a partnership rather than as an association taxable as a corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No transfer or assignment of units will be effective or recognized by a partnership if the transfer or assignment would result in the termination of that partnership for federal income tax purposes. Any attempt to transfer or assign units in violation of the limited partnership agreement will be ineffective.
Each partnership's structure has conflicts of interest.
•	The general partner, each commodity broker and the foreign currency forward and options counterparties are affiliates. As a result, the fees and other compensation received by those parties and other terms relating to the operation of the partnerships and the sale of the units have not been independently negotiated.
•	Employees of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated receive a portion of the brokerage fees paid by the partnerships. Therefore, those employees have a conflict of interest in advising you in the purchase or redemption of units.
