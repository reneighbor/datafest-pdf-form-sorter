Burr, Richard M.
Report necessary travel related expenses from each source aggregating more than $350 in value during the reporting period received by you, your spouse and/or dependent child in connection with your provision of services at a speaking engagement, fact-finding event, or other event (personal campaign, or otherwise). Disclosure is required regardless of whether those expenses were reimbursed to the individual or paid directly by the sponsoring organization. A description of the itinerary, including date(s) and the nature of expenses is required. If you are reimbursed for more than one trip from the same sponsor (and the trips added together are worth more than $350), then you must report each trip individually, even if the reimbursement for each separate trip does not equal more than $350. Report Gifts of travel in Part V.
Exclude: Travel related expenses provided by federal, state, D.C., and local governments; or by a foreign government; reimbursements from campaign funds which are reported to the FEC; reimbursements to a spouse or dependent child totally independent of his or her relationship to you; and reimbursements reported to the Office of Public Records pursuant to Senate Rule 35. For further information, see Instructions.
