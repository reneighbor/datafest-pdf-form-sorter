Diversified Program does not have any inherent preference for, or bias towards, any market, asset class or instrument but rather aims to maximize returns within liquidity constraints.
Risk Management
A fundamental principle of Aspect's investment approach is the importance of a robust risk management framework. Aspect employs a value-at-risk methodology and other risk management procedures to monitor the risk of the Aspect Diversified Program within pre-defined guidelines. Additionally, Aspect has developed mechanisms to control risk at both an individual market and portfolio level. In order to monitor and respond to changes in the trading conditions in a market at all times, Aspect believes a high level of transparency is required. This transparency is achieved by generally investing in liquid instruments with real time pricing, although this may not be possible in all markets or all instruments.
Research Commitment and Program Development
Aspect's commitment to developing market leading research means that it invests heavily in its research capability and that it is continually developing the Aspect Diversified Program and searching for new markets, instruments, asset classes and strategies to incorporate in it with the aim of improving risk/return characteristics, diversification and capacity. Subject to prior approval of the general partner for material changes, limited partners are advised that Aspect retains the right to develop and make certain changes to the Aspect Diversified Program.
The Aspect Diversified Program is proprietary and highly confidential to Aspect. Accordingly, the description of the Aspect Diversified Program as contained herein is general only and is not intended to be exhaustive or absolute.
THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT CHARTER ASPECT'S INVESTMENT PROGRAM WILL ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVE, AND CHARTER ASPECT'S ACTUAL INVESTMENT RESULTS MAY VARY SUBSTANTIALLY FROM ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE.
CHARTER ASPECT'S INVESTMENT PROGRAM IS SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL RISKS. THE USE OF FUTURES, FORWARDS AND OTHER INVESTMENT TECHNIQUES THAT ASPECT MAY EMPLOY FROM TIME TO TIME CAN SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE RISK TO WHICH CHARTER ASPECT'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS SUBJECT. ACCORDINGLY, CHARTER ASPECT'S ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES.
Performance Information of Aspect
The following summary performance information reflects (1) Capsule A: the results of a representative account traded pursuant to the Aspect Diversified Program from January 1999 through February 2008; and (2) Capsule B: the performance of such representative account adjusted to reflect the fees and expenses of Charter Aspect. The footnotes following Capsule B are an integral part of Capsules A and B.
The account selected as the representative account in Capsule A is that of the largest account traded pursuant to the Aspect Diversified Program. This representative account is not, however, subject to the same fees and other expenses of Charter Aspect, and such fees and expenses are reflected only in the pro forma performance information displayed in Capsule B on page 94.
You are cautioned that the information set forth in the following Capsule performance summaries is not necessarily indicative of, and may have no bearing on, any trading results that may be attained by Aspect or by Charter Aspect in the future, since past results are not a guarantee of future results. There can be no assurance that Aspect or Charter Aspect will make any profits at all, or will be able to avoid incurring substantial losses. You should also note that interest income may constitute a significant portion of a commodity pool's total income and, in certain instances, may generate profits where there have been realized or unrealized losses from commodity trading.
