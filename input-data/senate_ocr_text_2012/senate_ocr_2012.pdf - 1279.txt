•	assisting limited partners in the redemption or exchange of units; and
•	providing such other services as limited partners from time to time may reasonably request.
The additional compensation paid by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated may be deemed to be underwriting compensation. In addition, certain officers and directors of the general partner may receive compensation as employees of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated based, in part, on the amount of brokerage fees paid by the partnerships to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated. The selling agreement among Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, the general partner, and the partnerships provides that such compensation may only be paid by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated as long as these services are provided. Any limited partner may telephone, write or visit a financial advisor at a Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated branch office to avail himself of these services.
The aggregate of all compensation paid to employees of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated from the initial 3% gross sales credit and the redemption charges received by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated will not exceed 10% of the proceeds of the sale of units.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated may compensate any qualified additional selling agent for each unit sold by it by paying a selling commission, from Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated's own funds, as determined by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and the additional selling agent, but not to exceed 3% of the net asset value of the unit sold. Additional selling agents who are properly registered as futures commission merchants or introducing brokers with the CFTC and are members of the National Futures Association in such capacity may also receive from Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, payable from Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated's own funds, continuing compensation for providing to limited partners the continuing services described above. This additional compensation paid by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated may be up to 28% of the brokerage fees generated by outstanding units sold by additional selling agents and received by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated as commodity broker for the partnership (except for employees of affiliates of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, who will be compensated at the same rate as employees of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated). Additional selling agents may pay all or a portion of this additional compensation to their employees who have sold units and provide continuing services to limited partners if the employees are properly registered with the CFTC and are members of the National Futures Association. Additional compensation paid by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated may be deemed to be underwriting compensation.
At such time as the brokerage fees payable by the partnerships are reduced, the amounts payable to employees as described above may be reduced.
SUBSCRIPTION PROCEDURE
The minimum initial subscription for most subscribers is $20,000. However, in the case of an eligible subscriber who is an investor in another limited partnership for which Demeter Management Corporation serves as the general partner, that subscriber may redeem its interest in the other partnership and use the proceeds to invest in any one or more of the Charter Series partnerships in a Non-Series Exchange. The $20,000 minimum subscription for the Charter Series of partnerships will be satisfied if the proceeds from the redemption would have equaled at least $20,000 as of the last day of the month immediately preceding the monthly closing at which the Charter Series units are purchased, irrespective of whether the actual proceeds from the redemption are less than $20,000 when the units of the other partnership are redeemed. In all other circumstances, if the redemption proceeds are less than $20,000, the subscriber will have to pay the difference in cash.
However, a $5,000 minimum subscription requirement, instead of the typical $20,000 minimum subscription requirement, will apply to Non-Series Exchanges from the following limited partnerships: Morgan Stanley Cornerstone Fund II L.P., Morgan Stanley Cornerstone Fund III L.P.,
