disrupt the historical pricing relationships between different currencies and currency pairs. Interest rate changes, as well as political and general economic conditions, influence these fluctuations. The partnership trades a large number of currencies, including cross-rates — i.e., positions between two currencies other than the U.S. dollar. At December 31, 2007, the partnership's major exposures were to euro, Polish zloty, Hungarian forint, Norwegian krone, Czech koruna, and Swedish krona currency crosses, as well as to outright U.S. dollar positions. Outright positions consist of the U.S. dollar vs. other currencies. These other currencies include major and minor currencies. The general partner does not anticipate that the risk associated with the partnership's currency trades will change significantly in the future.
Equity. At December 31, 2007, the partnership had market exposure to the global stock index sector, primarily to equity price risk in the G-7 countries. The stock index futures traded by the partnership are by law limited to futures on broadly-based indices. At December 31, 2007, the partnership's primary market exposures were to the NIKKEI 225 (Japan), DAX (Germany), S&P MIB 30 (Italy), IBEX 35 (Spain), OMX 30 (Sweden), S&P 500 (U.S.), NASDAQ 100 (U.S.), FTSE 100 (United Kingdom), Hang Seng (Hong Kong), CAC 40 (France), SPI 200 (Australia), Euro Stoxx 50 (Europe), and TAIWAN (Taiwan) stock indices. The partnership is typically exposed to the risk of adverse price trends or static markets in the European, U.S., Chinese, Canadian, Japanese, and Australian stock indices. Static markets would not cause major market changes, but would make it difficult for the partnership to avoid trendless price movements, resulting in numerous small losses.
Commodity.
Energy. The largest market exposure of the partnership at December 31, 2007, was to the energy sector. The partnership's primary energy exposure was to futures contracts in crude oil and its related products, as well as natural gas. Price movements in these markets result from geopolitical developments, particularly in the Middle East, as well as weather patterns, and other economic fundamentals. Significant profits and losses, which have been experienced in the past, are expected to continue to be experienced in the future. Natural gas has exhibited volatility in price resulting from weather patterns and supply and demand factors and will likely continue in this choppy pattern.
Soft Commodities and Agriculturals. The second largest market exposure of the partnership at December 31, 2007, was to the markets that comprise these sectors. Most of the exposure was to the soybeans, soybean meal, corn, coffee, cocoa, soybean oil, wheat, lean hogs, live cattle, rapeseed, feeder cattle, and sugar markets. Supply and demand inequalities, severe weather disruptions, and market expectations affect price movements in these markets.
Metals. At December 31, 2007, the partnership had market exposure to the metals sector. The partnership's metals exposure was to fluctuations in the price of base metals, such as aluminum, zinc, copper, nickel, and lead, and precious metals, such as gold, silver, and platinum. Economic forces, supply and demand inequalities, geopolitical factors, and market expectations influence price movements in these markets. The trading advisor utilizes the trading system(s) to take positions when market opportunities develop, and the general partner anticipates that the trading advisor will continue to do so.
