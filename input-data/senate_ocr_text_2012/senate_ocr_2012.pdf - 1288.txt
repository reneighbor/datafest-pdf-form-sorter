been advised by its legal counsel that, in such counsel's opinion, expenses incurred by the partnerships in their futures, forward, and options trading businesses should not be subject to the 2% "floor" or the 3% phaseout, except to the extent that the Internal Revenue Service promulgates regulations that so provide. However, that advice is not binding on a court or the Internal Revenue Service, and the Internal Revenue Service could assert, and a court could agree, that such expenses of the partnerships (including incentive fees) are investment expenses which are subject to these limitations. In that case, individuals could not deduct investment advisory expenses in calculating their alternative minimum tax.
Tax Liability Will Exceed Distributions. Under federal tax laws, a limited partner must report and pay tax on his share of any partnership income each year, even though the general partner does not intend to make any distributions from the partnerships.
Tax on Capital Gains and Losses. In general, for individuals, trusts, and estates, "long-term capital gains" are currently taxed at a maximum marginal tax rate of 15% for gains recognized in taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2010. "Short-term capital gains" and other ordinary income generally are currently taxed at a maximum marginal tax rate of 35%. Corporate taxpayers are currently subject to a maximum marginal tax rate of 35% on all capital gains and income.
The excess of capital losses over capital gains is deductible by an individual against ordinary income on a one-for-one basis, subject to an annual limitation of $3,000 ($1,500 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return). Accordingly, a partnership could incur significant losses, but a limited partner would still be required to pay taxes on the limited partner's share of the partnership's interest income. Excess capital losses may be carried forward.
Net losses from Section 1256 contracts are treated as 60% long-term capital loss and 40% short-term capital loss. Such losses may, at the individual taxpayer's election, be carried back to each of the preceding three years and applied against gains from Section 1256 contracts.
Alternative Minimum Tax. The alternative minimum tax for individuals is imposed on "alternative minimum taxable income" in excess of certain exemption amounts. Alternative minimum taxable income consists of taxable income determined with certain adjustments and increased by the amount of items of tax preference. Alternative minimum taxable income may not be offset by certain interest deductions, including (in certain circumstances) interest incurred to purchase or carry units in the partnerships. Corporations are also subject to an alternative minimum tax. The extent to which the alternative minimum tax will be imposed will depend on the overall tax situation of each limited partner at the end of such taxable year.
Limitation on Deductibility of Interest on Investment Indebtedness. Interest paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allocable to property held for investment is investment interest. Such interest is generally deductible by non-corporate taxpayers only to the extent it does not exceed net investment income. A limited partner's distributive share of net partnership income and any gain from the disposition of units will be treated as investment income, except that a limited partner's net capital gain from the disposition of units is not investment income unless the limited partner waives the benefit of the preferential tax rate on such gain. It is not clear whether a limited partner's distributive share of partnership net capital gain constitutes investment income where such gain is taxed at the maximum rate for capital gains. Interest expense incurred by a limited partner to acquire his units generally will be investment interest. Any investment interest disallowed as a deduction in a taxable year solely by reason of the limitation above is treated as investment interest paid or accrued in the succeeding taxable year.
