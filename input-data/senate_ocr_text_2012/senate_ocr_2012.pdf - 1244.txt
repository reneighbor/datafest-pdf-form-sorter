The Graham Trading Programs
Graham currently trades approximately 50% of Charter Graham's assets pursuant to its Global Diversified Program, as described below, at 1.5 times the standard leverage it applies for such program and approximately 50% of Charter Graham's assets pursuant to its K4 Program, as described below, at 1.5 times the standard leverage it applies for such program. Margin requirements over time at standard leverage are expected to average about 13% to 20% of equity for accounts traded by Graham; thus, Graham expects the margin requirements for Charter Graham over time to average about 20% to 30% of Charter Graham's net assets. Increased leverage will alter risk exposure and may lead to greater profits and losses and trading volatility. See "Risk Factors—Trading and Performance Risks—The partnerships' trading is highly leveraged, which accentuates the trading profit or trading loss on a trade" on page 12, and "Risk Factors — Trading Advisor Risks — Charter Graham's use of an increased rate of leverage could affect performance" on page 16. Subject to the prior approval of the general partner, Graham may, at any time, trade a portion of the partnership's assets pursuant to one or more of Graham's other systematic programs and at an increased or reduced rate of leverage. In consultation with Graham, the general partner may, from time to time, reallocate the assets of a partnership among the trading programs offered by the trading advisor for the partnership.
As of February 29, 2008, Graham was managing approximately $676.8 million of funds in the Global Diversified Program at Standard Leverage, approximately $46.1 million of funds in the Global Diversified Program at 125% Leverage, approximately $556.4 million of funds in the Global Diversified Program at 150% Leverage, approximately $560.6 million in the K4 Program at Standard Leverage, approximately $459.3 million of funds in the K4 Program at 150% Leverage, approximately $266.5 million of funds in the Graham Selective Trading Program at Standard Leverage, approximately $16.6 million of funds in the Multi-Trend Program at Standard Leverage, approximately $224.1 million of funds in the Multi-Trend Program at 125% Leverage, and approximately $5.3 billion of assets in all of its trading programs.
Each Graham investment program is built around one or more of Graham's trend-following trading systems. Graham's trend systems are designed to participate selectively in potential profit opportunities that can occur during periods of price trends in a diverse number of U.S. and international markets. The trend systems establish positions in markets where the price action of a particular market signals the computerized systems used by Graham that a potential trend in prices is occurring. The trend systems are designed to analyze mathematically the recent trading characteristics of each market and statistically compare such characteristics to the historical trading patterns of the particular market. The trend systems also employ proprietary risk management and trade filter strategies that seek to benefit from sustained price trends while reducing risk and volatility exposure.
In connection with its programs' systematic trading, Graham may employ discretion in determining the leverage and timing of trades for new accounts and the market weighting and participation. In unusual or emergency market conditions, Graham may also utilize discretion in establishing positions or liquidating positions or otherwise reducing portfolio risk where Graham believes, in its sole discretion, that it is in the potential best interest of its clients to do so. While such actions are anticipated to occur very infrequently, no assurance can be given that Graham's discretionary actions in these programs will-enhance performance.
Global Diversified Program
The Global Diversified Program features the first trend system that Graham developed, which began trading client accounts in 1995. It utilizes multiple computerized trading models and offers broad diversification in both financial and non-financial markets, trading in approximately 65 global markets. The Global Diversified Program's trend system is primarily long-term in nature and is intended to generate significant returns over time with an acceptable degree of risk and volatility. The computer models on a daily basis analyze the recent price action, the relative strength and the risk characteristics of each market and compare statistically the quantitative results of this data to years of historical data on each market.
