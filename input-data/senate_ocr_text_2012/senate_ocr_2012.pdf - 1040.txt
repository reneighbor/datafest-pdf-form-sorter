Fund's allocation targets (which shall be within the allocation ranges then in effect), the Investment Committee will analyze the performance results associated with each potential Adviser Fund and its investment strategy to determine the return, risk, and correlation relationships within and between each investment strategy and potential Adviser Fund over time. The Investment Committee may also analyze existing and developing market, economic, and/or financial trends.
Step 4: The fourth step will see this due diligence effort revisited from time to time for the life of the Master Fund. The Investment Manager intends to monitor the overall level of assets managed, the estimated capacity of each Adviser Fund, any management or firm ownership changes and the adherence to the pre-defined strategy and risk/return targets set forth when the investment was made. The Investment Committee will regularly monitor the returns of each Adviser Fund in an effort to evaluate whether its return pattern is consistent with the expected return pattern for that particular Adviser Fund or investment strategy, as applicable. If any Adviser Fund's returns fall outside certain limits established by the Investment Committee, the Investment Committee may carry out a formal review of the Adviser Fund to determine if a reallocation of the Master Fund's assets is necessary. As a general matter, an Adviser who can provide statistical evidence that its management consistently outperforms its peers within the Adviser Fund's investment strategy (whether based on net performance after fees and expenses or on a risk-adjusted basis, taking into account volatility) will be favored over investment advisers whose records do not provide such evidence. In addition, the Investment Committee will also seek to add Adviser Funds that provide certain types of exposure or risk-return tendencies that complement the entire investment portfolio of the Funds or other Adviser Funds within that particular investment strategy.
RISK FACTORS
All investments carry risks to some degree. The Funds cannot guarantee that their investment objective will be achieved or that the Master Fund's strategy of investing in the Adviser Funds will be successful. Investments In The Funds Involve Substantial Risks, Including The Risk That The Entire Amount Invested May Be Lost. The Core Alternatives Fund, through its investment in the Master Fund, and the TEI Fund, through its investment in the Offshore Fund and Master Fund, allocate their assets to Advisers and invest in Adviser Funds (or open Adviser Accounts) that invest in and actively trade securities and other financial instruments using a variety of strategies and investment techniques that may involve significant risks. Various other types of risks are also associated with investments in the Funds, including risks relating to the fund of funds structure of the Master Fund, risks relating to the master-feeder structure of the Funds, risks relating to compensation arrangements and risks relating to the limited liquidity of the Units. In addition, Partners should be aware that by combining the Prospectus of each Fund into this one document, there is the possibility that one Fund may be liable for any misstatements in the Prospectus about the other Fund. To the extent a Fund incurs such liability, a Partner's investment in the Fund could be adversely affected.
GENERAL RISKS
LACK OF OPERATING HISTORY OF ADVISER FUNDS. Certain Adviser Funds may be newly formed entities that have no operating histories. In such cases, the Investment Manager may evaluate the past investment performance of the applicable Advisers or of their personnel. However, this past investment performance may not be indicative of the future results of an investment in an Adviser Fund. Although the Investment Manager, its affiliates and their personnel have considerable experience evaluating the performance of alternative asset managers and providing manager selection and asset allocation services to clients, the Funds' investment programs should be evaluated on the basis that there can be no assurance that the Investment Manager's assessments of Advisers, and in turn their assessments of the short-term or long-term prospects of investments, will prove accurate. Thus, the Funds may not achieve their investment objective and each Fund's NAV may decrease.
MASTER/FEEDER STRUCTURE. The Master Fund may accept investments from other investors (including other feeder funds), in addition to the Funds. The Master Fund currently has other investors that are feeder funds, and it may have additional investors in the future, including feeder funds managed by the Investment Manager or an affiliate thereof. Because each Fund and the Master Fund, as well as any other feeder fund, can set its own transaction minimums, feeder-specific expenses, and other conditions, one fund could offer access to the Master Fund on more attractive terms, or could experience better performance, than the Funds. Smaller feeder funds may be harmed by the actions of larger feeder funds. For example, a larger feeder fund will have more voting power than each Fund over the operations of the Master Fund. If other feeder funds tender for a significant portion of their interests in a repurchase offer, the assets of the Master Fund will decrease. This could cause each Fund's expense ratio to increase to the extent contributions to the Master Fund do not offset the cash outflows.
NON-DIVERSIFIED STATUS. Each Fund is "non-diversified" under the 1940 Act. That means that the Funds are not subject to limitations under the 1940 Act on the percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of any one issuer, market segment or Adviser Fund. Each Fund's and the Master Fund's NAVs may therefore experience greater volatility than that of an investment company that is subject to such limitations. This policy gives the^Master Fund more flexibility to invest in the obligations of a single borrower or issuer than if it were a "diversified" fund.
