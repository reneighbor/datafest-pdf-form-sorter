5. Net Worth of General Partner.
The General Partner agrees that at all times, as long as it remains a general partner of the Partnership, it shall maintain its net worth at an amount not less than 10% of the total contributions to the Partnership by all Partners and to any other limited partnership for which it acts as a general partner by all such partnership's partners; provided, however, that if the total contributions to the Partnership by all Partners, or to any limited partnership for which it acts as a general partner by all partners, are less than $2,500,000, then with respect to the Partnership and any such limited partnership, the General Partner shall maintain its net worth at an amount of at least 15% of the total contributions to the Partnership by all Partners and of the total contributions to any such limited partnership for which it acts as a general partner by all such partnership's partners or $250,000, whichever is the lesser; and, provided, further, that in no event shall the General Partner's net worth be less than $50,000.

The interests owned by the General Partner in the Partnership and any other partnerships for which it acts as a general partner and any notes and accounts receivable from and payable to any limited partnership in which it has an interest shall not be included as an asset in calculating its net worth, but any notes receivable from an "affiliate" (as such term is defined in Regulation S-X of the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")) of the General Partner or letters of credit may be included.
The General Partner agrees that it shall not be a general partner of any limited partnership other than the Partnership unless, at all times when it is a general partner of any such additional limited partnership, its net worth is at least equal to the net worth required by the preceding paragraph of this Section 5.
