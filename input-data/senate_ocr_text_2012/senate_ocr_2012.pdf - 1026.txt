FUNDS SUMMARY
This is only a summary. This summary does not contain all of the information that Investors should consider before investing in
the Funds. Investors should review the more detailed information appearing elsewhere in this Prospectus and SAI, especially the
information set forth under the heading "RISK FACTORS."
The Funds and the Units	Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund, L.P. (the "Core Alternatives Fund") is a closed-end,
management investment company, organized as a Delaware limited partnership on November 23, 2004. Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Fund, L.P. (the "TEI Fund") is a closed-end, management investment company, organized as a Delaware limited partnership on October 29, 2004. The Core Alternatives Fund and the TEI Fund (together, the "Funds") are non-diversified, which means that under the 1940 Act, the Funds are not limited in the amount of assets that they may invest in any single issuer of securities. Limited partnership interests of the Funds were offered in private placement from April 1, 2005 until the Funds became publicly offered beginning on November 3, 2008. The Core Alternatives Fund invests substantially all of its assets in Hatteras Master Fund, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Master Fund"), which is also registered under the 1940 Act. The TEI Fund invests substantially all of its assets in the Hatteras Core Alternatives Offshore Fund, LDC (the "Offshore Fund"), a Cayman Islands limited duration company with the same investment objective as the TEI Fund. The Offshore Fund invests substantially all of its assets in the Master Fund. The Master Fund invests substantially all of its assets with a number of independent trading advisers ("Advisers") selected by Hatteras Investment Partners, LLC ("HIP"), the investment manager of the Master Fund (in such capacity, the "Investment Manager"), that are typically available on a collective basis to larger institutions. The Investment Manager primarily pursues the Funds' objective investing the Master Fund's assets with each Adviser either by becoming a participant in an investment vehicle operated by the Adviser (each, an "Adviser Fund," which includes exchange-traded funds ("ETFs"), hedge funds, private investment funds and other investment funds) or by placing assets in an account directly managed by the Adviser (each, an "Adviser Account"). See "Fund Structure" on prior page.
The General Partner	Hatteras Investment Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, serves as
the general partner of the Funds and of the Master Fund (in each case, the "General Partner"). The General Partner has irrevocably delegated to the boards of directors of the Funds (the "Boards") its rights and powers to monitor and oversee the business affairs of the Funds, including the complete and exclusive authority to oversee and establish policies regarding the management, conduct and operation of the Funds' business.
Investment Objective and Strategies The Master Fund has the same investment objective as the Funds and the Offshore Fund,
which is to provide capital appreciation consistent with the return characteristic of the alternative investment portfolios of larger endowments. The Funds' secondary objective is to provide capital appreciation with less volatility than that of the equity markets.
The Investment Manager	As Investment Manager, Hatteras Investment Partners, LLC provides day-to-day
investment management services to the Master Fund. Its principal place of business is located at 8540 Colonnade Center Dr., Suite 401, Raleigh, NC 27615, Telephone (888) 363-2324, Facsimile (816) 860-3138. The Investment Manager is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"). As of March 31, 2011, approximately $1.95 billion of assets were under the management of the Investment Manager and its affiliates. In order to comply with applicable Cayman Islands law, the Investment Manager holds a nominal, non-voting interest in the Offshore Fund. For further information, see Part 2 of Form ADV of the Investment Manager, which is available on the SEC's website and upon request to the Investment Manager at (888) 363-2324.

("Management Fee") equal to 1/12^ of 1.00% (1.00% on an annualized basis) of the aggregate value of the Master Fund's net assets as of the end of each month. The Management Fee will be paid to the Investment Manager before giving effect to any
