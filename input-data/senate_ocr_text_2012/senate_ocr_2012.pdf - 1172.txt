in any Charter Series partnership, you may increase that investment or make an investment in any other Charter Series partnership by making a contribution of at least $1,000. In the case of a Charter Series exchange, you must exchange a minimum of 100 units, unless you are liquidating your entire interest in a partnership.
If you are an investor in another non-Charter Series limited partnership for which Demeter Management Corporation serves as the general partner, you may redeem your interest in that partnership and use the redemption proceeds to invest in any one or more of the Charter Series of partnerships. This is referred to as a Non-Series Exchange. The $20,000 minimum subscription for the Charter Series of partnerships will be satisfied if the proceeds from the redemption would have equaled at least $20,000 as of the last day of the month immediately preceding the monthly closing at which the Charter Series units are purchased, irrespective of whether the actual proceeds from the redemption are less than $20,000 when the units of the other partnership are redeemed. In all other circumstances, if the redemption proceeds are less than $20,000, you will have to pay the difference in cash.
However, a $5,000 minimum subscription requirement, instead of the typical $20,000 minimum subscription requirement, will apply to Non-Series Exchanges from the following limited partnerships: Morgan Stanley Cornerstone Fund II L.P., Morgan Stanley Cornerstone Fund III L.P., Morgan Stanley Cornerstone Fund IV L.P., Morgan Stanley Diversified Futures Fund L.P., Morgan Stanley Diversified Futures Fund III L.P., Morgan Stanley Principal Plus Fund L.P., and Morgan Stanley Portfolio Strategy Fund L.P. If the redemption proceeds in a Non-Series Exchange from one of these partnerships are less than $5,000, you will have to pay the difference in cash.
If you are making a Non-Series Exchange, regardless of whether the $5,000 or the $20,000 minimum subscription for the Charter Series of partnerships requirement applies, you will be required to invest at least $5,000 in any Charter Series partnership for which you subscribe.
The general partner may, in its sole discretion, reject any subscription in whole or in part.
Financial Suitability
Unless otherwise specified in the subscription agreement under "State Suitability Requirements," you must have either a net worth of at least $250,000, exclusive of home, furnishings, and automobiles, or both a net worth of at least $70,000, exclusive of home, furnishings, and automobiles, and an annual gross income of at least $70,000. You should be aware, however, that certain states impose more restrictive financial suitability standards and/or maximum investment limits. Before.you invest you will be required to represent and warrant that you meet the applicable state minimum financial suitability standard set forth in the subscription agreement, which may also include a maximum investment limit.
Limited Revocation Right
After you subscribe for units in any Charter Series partnership, you will have limited rights to revoke your subscription. You may only revoke a subscription and receive a full refund of the subscription amount, plus any accrued interest, by delivering written notice to your Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated financial advisor who must forward the notice so that it is received by the general partner no later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of the applicable monthly closing.
