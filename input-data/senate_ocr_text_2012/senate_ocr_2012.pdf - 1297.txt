Pursuant to authority in the Commodity Exchange Act, the National Futures Association has been formed and registered with the CFTC as a "registered futures association." At the present time, the National Futures Association is the only non-exchange self-regulatory organization for commodities professionals. National Futures Association members are subject to National Futures Association standards relating to fair trade practices, financial condition, and consumer protection. As the self-regulatory body of the commodities industry, the National Futures Association promulgates rules governing the conduct of commodity professionals and disciplines those professionals who do not comply with such standards. The CFTC has delegated to the National Futures Association responsibility for the registration of commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, futures commission merchants, introducing brokers, and their respective associated persons and floor brokers. The general partner, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, and the trading advisors are all members of the National Futures Association (the partnerships themselves are not required to become members of the National Futures Association).
The CFTC has no authority to regulate trading on non-U.S. commodity exchanges and markets. See "Risk Factors — Trading and Performance Risks — Trading on non-U.S. exchanges presents greater risks to each partnership than trading on U.S. exchanges" on page 13.
Margins
"Initial" or "original" margin is the minimum amount of funds that a futures trader must deposit with his commodity broker in order to initiate futures trading or to maintain an open position in futures contracts. "Maintenance" margin is the amount (generally less than initial margin) to which a trader's account may decline before he must deliver additional margin. A margin deposit is like a cash performance bond. It helps assure the futures trader's performance of the futures contracts he purchases or sells. Futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on margins that represent a very small percentage (ranging upward from less than 2%) of the purchase price of the underlying commodity being traded. Because of such low margins, price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that are greater, in relation to the amount invested, than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation. The minimum amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set by the exchange on which such contract is traded, and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract. See "Risk Factors — Trading and Performance Risks — The partnerships' trading is highly leveraged, which accentuates the trading profit or trading loss on a trade," on page 12.
Brokerage firms, such as Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and Morgan Stanley & Co. International pic, carrying accounts for traders in futures contracts may not accept lower, and generally require higher, amounts of margin as a matter of policy in order to afford further protection for themselves. The commodity brokers presently intend to require each partnership to make margin deposits equal to the exchange minimum levels for all futures contracts.
Margin requirements are computed each day by a trader's commodity broker. When the market value of a particular open futures contract position changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements, a margin call is made by the commodity broker. If the margin call is not met within a reasonable time, the broker may close out the trader's position. With respect to a partnership's trading, that partnership, and not its limited partners personally or any other partnership, will be subject to margin calls.
