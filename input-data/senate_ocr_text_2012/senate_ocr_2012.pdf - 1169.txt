Before you invest you will be required to represent and warrant that you meet the applicable state minimum financial suitability standard set forth in the subscription agreement, which may also include a maximum investment limit.
Because this is a summary, it does not contain all of the information that may be important to you. You should read the entire prospectus and its exhibits carefully before you decide to invest.
The Morgan Stanley Charter Series consists of three continuously-offered limited partnerships and one closed-end limited partnership, each organized in the State of Delaware:
* Effective May 1, 2006, the general partner no longer accepts subscriptions and/ or exchanges for units of this partnership.
The offices of each partnership are located at 522 Fifth Avenue, 13th Floor, New York, New York 10036, telephone (212) 296-1999.
Each partnership provides the opportunity to invest in futures, forward, and options contracts managed by an experienced, professional trading advisor. Since each partnership's assets are traded by a different trading advisor, each employing a different trading program, you should review the specific information relating to each partnership and its trading advisor to better understand how a partnership may fit into your overall investment plan. If you decide to invest in more than one partnership, you may allocate your investment among any one or more of the partnerships and, after an initial six-month holding period, you may shift your investment among one or more of the other Charter Series partnerships.
A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a fixed amount of a commodity or other underlying product, instrument, or index at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. In order to secure its obligation to make or take delivery under a futures contract, the trader must deposit funds, referred to as margin, with the commodity broker through which it trades. An option on a futures contract gives the buyer of the option, in exchange for a one-time payment known as premium, the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a futures contract at a specified price within a specified period of time. The seller of an option on a futures contract receives the premium payment and has the obligation to buy or sell the futures contract at the specified price
