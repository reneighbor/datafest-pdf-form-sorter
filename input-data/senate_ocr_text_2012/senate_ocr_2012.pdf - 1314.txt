Each partnership normally trades a portfolio of diverse futures, forwards, and options, but may trade a greater or lesser number of futures, forwards, and options from time to time. Each limited partner will obtain greater diversification in futures, forwards, and options traded than would be possible trading individually, unless substantially more than the minimum investment described herein were committed to the futures, forward, and options markets.
Exchange Right
At the sixth month-end after a person first becomes a limited partner in any Charter Series partnership, and each calendar month thereafter, a limited partner may shift his investment among the partnerships. This permits a limited partner to select one or more continuously-offered partnerships which best suit his investment needs and objectives, which may change from time to time. A limited partner is not required to pay any redemption charges in connection with a Charter Series exchange or a Non-Series Exchange.
Diversified Professional Trading Management
Trading decisions for each partnership will be made by a trading advisor retained by the general partner. The trading approaches employed on behalf of each partnership by its trading advisor are not available for investments as small as the required minimum investment in each partnership. A limited partner can diversify his professional trading management by dividing his investment among two or all three of the partnerships. For example, an investor owning units of all three continuously-offered partnerships in the Charter Series would have the benefit of having his investment managed by three different trading advisors.
Limited Liability
Unlike an individual who invests directly in futures, forwards, and options, an investor in a partnership cannot be individually subject to margin calls and cannot lose more than the amount of his unredeemed capital contribution, his share of undistributed profits, if any, and, under certain circumstances, any distributions and amounts received upon redemption, or deemed received on an exchange of units, and interest thereon.
Interest Income
Many commodity brokers permit accounts above a certain size to deposit margin for futures, forwards, and options in the form of interest-bearing obligations, such as U.S. Treasury bills, rather than cash, thus enabling the account to earn interest on funds being used for futures trading, or such brokers pay interest at U.S. Treasury bill rates on a portion of the cash deposited in the account. Each partnership deposits its assets in separate commodity trading accounts with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated. Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated will credit each partnership with interest income on the partnership's funds on deposit with the commodity brokers at each month-end. Generally, an individual trader would not receive any interest on the funds in his commodity account unless he committed substantially more than the minimum investment required for the partnerships. While the partnerships are credited with interest by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated on the respective percentage of their assets deposited as margin as described above, the form of margin posted, whether cash or interest-bearing obligations (such as U.S. Treasury bills), does not reduce the risks inherent in the trading of futures, forwards, and options.
Administrative Convenience
The partnerships are structured so as to provide limited partners with numerous services designed to alleviate the administrative details involved in engaging directly in futures, forward, and options trading, including monthly and annual financial reports (showing, among other things, the net asset value of a unit, trading profits or losses, and expenses), and all tax information relating to the partnerships necessary for limited partners to complete their U.S. federal income tax returns. .
