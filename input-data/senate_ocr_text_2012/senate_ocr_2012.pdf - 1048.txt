can be influenced by a variety of global economic, financial and political factors and may fluctuate substantially over short periods of time, and such investments may be more volatile than other types of investments. At times, the performance of these companies may lag the performance of the broader stock market. In addition, Adviser Funds and Adviser Accounts may, but the Funds do not expect that they would, invest in energy and natural resources directly.
Adviser Funds may invest in securities of companies in the health care sector. Many health care-related companies are smaller and less seasoned than companies in other sectors and may be strongly affected by scientific or technological developments. Additionally, many health care-related companies offer products and services that are subject to governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies or laws, which may impact the returns of Adviser Funds investing in this sector.
Adviser Funds may invest in the financial services sector. Financial, business and economic factors, including market conditions, interest rates, economic, regulatory and financial developments, and are likely to have a substantial impact on Adviser Funds' holdings. The financial services sector is subject to extensive government regulation, which can limit the amounts and types of loans and other financial commitments that companies can make, the interest rates and fees that they can charge and the manner in which they distribute their products. Profitability can be largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital and can fluctuate significantly when interest rates change. Credit losses resulting from financial difficulties of borrowers can negatively affect lending institutions. Insurance companies can be subject to severe price competition. The financial services sector generally is undergoing rapid change.
Adviser Funds may invest in the technology sector. Technology companies may produce or use products or services that prove commercially unsuccessful, become obsolete or become adversely impacted by government regulation. Competitive pressures in the technology sector, and Adviser Fund's concentration in technology company securities, may subject it to more volatile price movements than a more diversified securities portfolio.
ENHANCED FIXED INCOME
High Yield Debt Advisers may deal in and with restricted or marketable securities and a significant portion of a High Yield Debt Adviser's portfolio may be invested in restricted securities that may not be registered and for which a market may not be readily available (i.e., not freely traded).
High Yield Debt securities generally trade at discounts (sometimes substantial discounts) to par value because many investors are either prohibited from, or willingly avoid, investing due to the complexity of determining the securities' true risk/reward profile. Accordingly, High Yield Debt Adviser Funds typically experience significantly more volatility and risk than traditional fixed income Adviser Funds. To mitigate some of this risk, a High Yield Debt Adviser may use certain hedging tools, such as "shorting" securities in other portions of the capital structure (e.g., being "long" the high yield debt position and "short" the issuer's common stock) in order to mitigate the risk associated with an investment in the company (which may well be highly leveraged). There can be no assurance that any such hedging techniques will be successful or that the hedging employed by the Adviser will not have the negative effect of lowering overall returns, or creating losses, in the portfolio or with respect to the applicable position.
A significant portion of a Distressed Securities Adviser's portfolio may be invested in restricted securities that may not be registered and for which a market may not be readily available, and therefore a significant portion of the portfolio may not be freely traded. Investments may involve both U.S. and non-U.S. entities and may utilize leverage. In addition, a Distressed Securities Adviser may use certain hedging tools, such as "shorting" securities in other portions of the capital structure (e.g., being "long" the distressed securities position and "short" the issuer's common stock) in order to mitigate the risk associated with an investment in an otherwise "troubled" company. There can be no assurance that any such hedging techniques will be successful or that the hedging employed by the Adviser will not have the negative effect of lowering overall returns, or creating losses, in the portfolio or with respect to the applicable position. Distressed Securities Adviser Funds typically experience significantly more volatility and risk than traditional fixed income Adviser Funds.
Given liquidity issues, currency risk, credit risk, interest rate risk and geo-political risks, Global Debt Adviser Funds typically experience significantly more volatility and risk than traditional fixed income Adviser Funds. To mitigate some of this risk, a Global Debt Adviser may use certain hedging tools, such as "shorting" securities in other portions of the capital structure (e.g., being "long" the global debt position and "short" the issuer's common stock) or buying protection for a decline in the native currency or the U.S. dollar in order to mitigate the risk associated with an investment in a particular Global Debt security. There can be no assurance that any such hedging techniques will be successful or that the hedging employed by the Adviser will not have the negative effect of lowering overall returns, or creating losses, in the portfolio or with respect to the applicable position. Given the markets in which it invests, a significant portion of a Global Debt Adviser's portfolio may be invested in restricted securities that may not be registered and for which a market may hot be readily available, and therefore a significant portion of the portfolio may not be freely traded.
