Markets Traded. The Winton system trades in all the easily accessible and liquid commodity interests that it practically can. Winton's portfolio mainly consists of commodity interests which are futures, options and forward contracts in the following areas: stock indices; bonds; short term interest rates; currencies; precious and base metals; grains; livestock; energy and agricultural products and certain over-the-counter products such as swaps. Winton is constantly looking for new opportunities to add additional markets to the portfolio, thus further increasing the portfolio's diversification,
Diversification of Markets. Taking positions in a variety of unrelated markets has been shown, over time, to decrease system volatility. By employing a sophisticated and systematic schema for placing orders in a wide array of markets, Winton believes it can be demonstrated that there is a high expectation of an overall profit being realized after a sufficient period of time.
The trading strategy and account management principles described here are factors upon which Winton will base its trading decisions. Such principles may be revised from time to time by Winton as it deems advisable or necessary. Accordingly, no assurance is given that all of these factors will be considered with respect to every trade or recommendation made or that consideration of any of these factors in a particular situation will lessen risk of loss or increase the potential for profits.
Execution of Orders and Order Allocation
Winton will select the type of order to be used in executing trades and may use any type of order permitted by the exchange on which the order is placed.
Winton may place individual orders for each account or a block order for all accounts in which the same commodity interest is being cleared through the same futures commission merchant. In the latter instance, Winton will allocate trades to accounts using a proprietary algorithm. The aim of this algorithm is to achieve an average price for transactions as close as mathematically possible for each account. This takes the form of an optimization process where the objective is to minimize the variation in the average traded price for each account. On occasion, it may direct the futures commission merchant for the accounts to employ a neutral allocation system to assign trades. Partial fills will be allocated in proportion to account size.
Past Performance of Winton
Set forth below are the following Capsules: Capsule A is the past performance history of Winton's Diversified Trading Program and Capsule B is the pro forma performance capsule of the Winton Diversified Trading Program adjusted to reflect the fees, expenses and interest income of Charter WCM. The footnotes following Capsule B are an integral part of the Capsules.
You are cautioned that the information set forth in the following Capsule performance summaries is not necessarily indicative of, and may have no bearing on, any trading results that may be attained by Winton or Charter WCM in the future, since past results are not a guarantee of future results. There can be no assurance that Winton or the partnership will make any profits at all, or will be able to avoid incurring substantial losses. You should also note that interest income may constitute a significant portion of a commodity pool's total income and, in certain instances, may generate profits where there have been realized or unrealized losses from commodity trading.
THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT CHARTER WCM'S TRADING PROGRAM WILL ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVE, AND CHARTER WCM'S ACTUAL INVESTMENT RESULTS MAY VARY SUBSTANTIALLY FROM ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE.
CHARTER WCM'S TRADING PROGRAM IS SPECULATIVE AND INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL RISKS. THE USE OF FUTURES, FORWARDS AND OTHER INVESTMENT TECHNIQUES THAT WINTON MAY EMPLOY FROM TIME TO TIME CAN SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE RISK TO WHICH CHARTER WCM'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS SUBJECT. ACCORDINGLY, CHARTER WCM'S ACTIVITIES COULD RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL LOSSES.
