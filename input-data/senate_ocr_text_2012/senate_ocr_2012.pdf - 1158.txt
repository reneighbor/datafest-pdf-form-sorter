(c)	Each Partner recognizes that in the event that this Section 8.10 is breached by any Partner or any of its principals, Partners, members, directors, officers, employees or agents or any of the Partner's Affiliates, including any of the Affiliate's principals, Partners, members, directors, officers, employees or agents, irreparable injury may result to the non-breaching Partners and the Partnership.

If any non-breaching Partner or the Partnership ("Initiating Non-Breaching Party") determines that any other Partner or any of that Partner's principals, Partners, members, directors, officers, employees or agents or any of the Partner's Affiliates, including any of the Affiliates' principals, Partners, members, directors, officers, employees or agents, should be enjoined from or required to take any action to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information, each of the other non-breaching Partners agrees to join the non-breaching Initiating Non-Breaching Party in pursuing injunctive relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction.
(d)	The General Partner will have the right to keep confidential from the Limited Partners, for any period of time as the General Partner deems reasonable in its sole discretion, any information that the General Partner reasonably believes to be in the nature of trade secrets or other information the disclosure of which the General Partner in good faith believes is not in the best interest of the Partnership or could damage the Partnership or its business or that the Partnership is required by law or by agreement with a third party to keep confidential.
