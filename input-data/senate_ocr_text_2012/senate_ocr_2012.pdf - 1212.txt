approximately 6.5% were recorded in the currency markets, primarily from positions in the euro relative to the Japanese yen, the U.S. dollar, and the British pound. During January, long positions in the euro versus most of its rivals incurred losses as the value of the euro reversed sharply lower in what many analysts described as a "corrective" move after its strong upward trend during the fourth quarter of 2004. This decline in the value of the euro was attributed to weak economic data out of the European Union. Additional losses were incurred during August from short positions in the euro versus the U.S. dollar, British pound, and Japanese yen as the value of the euro advanced against its major rivals in response to strong signals of Euro-Zone economic improvement. In December, short positions in the euro against the U.S. dollar resulted in losses as the value of the euro increased on the possibility that the European Central Bank could raise interest rates in 2006. Elsewhere in the currency markets, losses resulted from positions in the South African rand, New Zealand dollar, and Australian dollar relative to the U.S dollar primarily during January, as the value of the U.S. dollar moved erratically amid speculation that U.S." interest rates were likely to continue to rise and on fears that the re-valuation of the Chinese yuan was farther away than expected. Additional losses were incurred during December from long positions in the New Zealand dollar relative to the U.S. dollar as the value of the New Zealand dollar declined on weaker than expected economic growth data and investor confidence that further interest rate hikes from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand were unlikely. Additional losses of approximately 1.2% were incurred in the agricultural complex primarily during April from long futures positions in wheat as prices fell in response to favorable weather in growing regions, improved crop conditions, and reduced foreign demand. Elsewhere in the agricultural complex, losses were incurred from long positions in cotton futures during May as prices declined on news of weak demand in China. Smaller losses were experienced from positions in soybean meal futures through a majority of the year. In the energy markets, losses of approximately 0.2% were recorded during January from short futures positions in crude oil as prices moved higher amid speculation that OPEC would move to cut production later in the month and on forecasts for cold winter weather in the Northeastern U.S. In April, long futures positions in crude oil incurred losses after prices reversed lower as U.S. government data pointed to greater production activity by refiners and rising supplies. Prices were also pressured lower by the release of slower demand growth forecasts. Further losses were experienced during June, September, October, and December from both long and short positions in crude oil futures as prices moved without consistent direction amid conflicting news regarding supply and demand, as well as due to weather related factors. A portion of the partnership's overall losses for the year was offset by gains of approximately 3.7% recorded in the global stock index futures markets during February from long positions in European and Japanese equity index futures as prices moved higher early in the month amid the elections in Iraq and lower than expected unemployment data out of the U.S. Equity prices in Japan were also pressured higher when positive economic data painted a brighter picture of the Far East Region's economy. In June, further gains were recorded from long positions in European equity index futures as prices rallied on the perception that weakness in the euro could stimulate the European economy. Prices were also bolstered by strong economic data out of the U.S. and news of a trade deal between the European Union and China that would avoid tariffs and manage the growth of Chinese textile imports to Europe through the end of 2008. During July, long positions in European and Japanese equity index benefited as prices increased on positive economic data out of the U.S. and Japan. Prices continued to strengthen after China reformed its U.S. dollar currency peg policy, leading market participants to conclude that a re-valuation of the Chinese yuan would likely ease trade tensions between China, the U.S., Europe, and Japan. In September, long positions in Japanese stock index futures experienced gains as prices moved sharply higher on positive comments from Bank of Japan Governor Toshihiko Fukui, who said the Japanese economy was in the process of emerging from a soft patch as demonstrated by rising production, improving business sentiment, and a sustained upturn in consumer spending. Additional gains resulted from long positions in European stock index futures amid declining oil prices and as investors embraced signs that the global economy could move forward despite Hurricane Katrina's devastation of the U.S. Gulf Coast.
