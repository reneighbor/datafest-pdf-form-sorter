CORE ALTERNATIVES FUND
Allocation of Profits and Losses. Under the Partnership Agreement, the Fund's net capital appreciation or net capital depreciation for each accounting period is allocated among the Partners and to their capital accounts without regard to the amount of income or loss actually recognized by the Fund for federal income tax purposes. The Partnership Agreement provides that items of income, deduction, gain, loss or credit actually recognized by the Fund for each fiscal year generally are to be allocated for income tax purposes among the Partners pursuant to the principles of Regulations issued under Sections 704(b) and 704(c) of the Code, based upon amounts of the Fund's net capital appreciation or net capital depreciation allocated to each Partner's capital account for the current and prior fiscal years.
Under the Partnership Agreement, the General Partner has the discretion to allocate specially an amount of the Fund's capital gain (including short-term capital gain) for federal income tax purposes to a withdrawing Partner to the extent that the Partner's capital account exceeds his federal income tax basis in his partnership Units (net of his allocable share of partnership liabilities). There can be no assurance that, if the General Partner makes such a special allocation, the Service will accept such allocation. If such allocation were to be successfully challenged by the Service, the Fund's gains allocable to the remaining Partners would be increased.
Tax Elections; Returns; Tax Audits. The General Partner will decide how to report the partnership items on both the Core Alternatives Fund's and the Master Fund's tax returns, and all Partners are required under the Code to treat the items consistently on their own federal income tax returns, unless they file a statement with the Service disclosing the inconsistency. Given the uncertainty and complexity of the tax laws, it is possible that the Service may not agree with the manner in which the Core Alternatives Fund's and Master Fund's items have been reported. In the event the income tax returns of either of those Funds are audited by the Service, the tax treatment of their income and deductions generally is determined at the limited partnership level in a single proceeding rather than by individual audits of the Partners. The General Partner, designated as the "tax matters partner," has considerable authority to make decisions affecting the tax treatment and procedural rights of all Partners. In addition, the tax matters partner has the power to extend the statute of limitations relating to the Partners' tax liabilities with respect to Fund tax items, and, unless a Partner objects, the authority to bind each Partner to settlement agreements with respect to tax items of the Master Fund.
The Code provides for optional adjustments to the basis of partnership property upon distributions of partnership property to a partner and transfers of partnership interests (including by reason of death) provided that a partnership election has been made pursuant to Section 754. Under the Partnership Agreement, at the request of a Partner, the General Partner, in its sole discretion, may cause the Fund to make such an election. Any such election, once made, cannot be revoked without the Service's consent. As a result of the complexity and added expense of the tax accounting required to implement such an election, the General Partner currently does not intend to make such election. Under some circumstances, however, a downward basis adjustment may be mandatory.
Tax Consequences of Fund Distributions
Distributions of Cash. Except as provided above, a Partner receiving a cash liquidating distribution from the Fund, in connection with a complete withdrawal from the Fund, generally will recognize capital gain or loss to the extent of the difference between the proceeds received by the Partner and the Partner's adjusted tax basis in his Units. The capital gain or loss will be short-term, longr term, or some combination of both, depending upon the timing of the Partner's contributions to the Fund. However, a withdrawing Partner will recognize ordinary income to the extent of the Partner's allocable share of the Fund's "unrealized receivables" (as determined pursuant to the Regulations). For these purposes, accrued but untaxed market discount, if any, on securities held by the Fund will be treated as an unrealized receivable, with respect to which a withdrawing Partner will recognize ordinary income.
A Partner receiving a cash nonliquidating distribution will generally recognize income and/or gain only (1) to the extent of the unrealized receivables allocable to the portion of the Partner's Units that is being redeemed, which amount will be ordinary income, and (2) to the extent that the amount of the distribution exceeds the sum of (a) the Partner's adjusted tax basis in all of the Partner's Units and (b) the amount of such unrealized receivables, which amount will be capital gain.
As discussed above, the Partnership Agreement provides that the General Partner may specially allocate items of the Fund's capital gain (including short-term capital gain) to a withdrawing Partner to the extent the withdrawing Partner's capital account would otherwise exceed his adjusted tax basis in his Units (net of his allocable share of partnership liabilities). Such a special allocation may result in the withdrawing Partner recognizing capital gain, which may include short-term gain, in the Partner's last taxable year in the Fund, with an equal and offsetting reduction in the amount of long-term capital gain recognized by the Partner on the liquidating distribution upon withdrawal.
Distributions of Property. Subject to the discussion below, a partner's receipt of a distribution of property from a partnership is generally not taxable. However, under Section 731 of the Code, a distribution consisting of marketable securities generally is treated as a distribution of cash (rather than property) unless the distributing partnership is an "investment partnership" within the meaning of
