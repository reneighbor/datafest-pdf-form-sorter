Dear Mr. Secretary:
Enclosed is the Senate Public Financial Disclosure Report for Herbert H. Kohl, United States Senator from Wisconsin. The forms have been completed in accordance with the instructions provided by your office.
To assist you and others in interpreting the data provided by this report, please note the following:
1.	In March 1990, Senator Kohl transferred a significant majority of the assets from K & L Trust to L & R Trust, a qualified blind trust which had been established in December 1989. As the report indicates, K & L Trust retained ownership of certain of Senator Kohl's assets. The trustees of K & L Trust make all investment and operational decisions without Senator Kohl's knowledge or involvement. In 2010 Senator Kohl transferred ownership of his ranch and: other personal assets to the Herbert H. Kohl 2010 Trust, a Trust whose sole trustee is Senator Kohl. Senator Kohl retains ownership of Milwaukee Bucks, Inc.
2.	The report requires disclosure of items of income such as dividends, interest and capital gains, but not of any losses or expenditures to generate income. Therefore, losses or expenditures incurred to generate the income disclosed in the report are not disclosed in the report. During the 12-month period covered by the report (January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011) K & L Trust did incur losses from various investment activities. K & L Trust, with respect to its activities, and Senator Kohl, with respect to Milwaukee Bucks, Inc., also incurred significant expenditures in generating the reported income.
Very truly yours,
