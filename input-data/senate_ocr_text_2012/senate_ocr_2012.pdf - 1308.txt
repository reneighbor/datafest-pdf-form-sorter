Notes to "Managed Futures vs. Stocks" Table:
Stocks are represented by the S&P 500 Index, provided by PerTrac Financial Solutions, LLC, Memphis, TN; managed futures are represented by the Barclay CTA Index, provided by Barclay Hedge Ltd., Fairfield, IA. Each bar represents the asset class performance derived from successive 12-month hypothetical holding periods or windows. (A 12-month holding period is defined as a period of 12 consecutive months, i.e., from January 1989 to December 1989; the next would be from February 1989 to January 1990, etc.) Performance of any of these indices (which, by definition, are averages of many individual investments) may not be representative of any specific investment within that index's asset class.
By overlaying returns, investors can see the potential benefits of a diversified portfolio that includes both traditional and alternative investments. There are many times when both the managed futures and stock indices showed positive performance. Obviously, though, there is no investment that only appreciates. There are 42 periods when managed futures showed negative returns, while stocks experienced 60 periods of negative returns during the studied time frame. While not a guarantee of future results, this chart illustrates the non-correlated aspect of managed futures. This non-correlation enables investors with managed futures to potentially lower the overall volatility of their portfolios.
The managed futures data discussed reflect the fee structures of trading advisors managing individual accounts and do not reflect fee structures of commodity pools, which are typically higher. The comparison of the S&P 500 Index and the Barclay CTA Index is for illustrative purposes only. The Barclay CTA Index attempts to provide a benchmark of representative performance of the money managers within the managed futures industry. As of 2008, the Barclay CTA Index is comprised of over 492 money managers, all of which have at least four years of prior performance history. The Barclay CTA Index is unweighted and rebalanced at the beginning of each year. Accordingly, the Barclay CTA Index is not a proxy for, or otherwise representative of, any specific Morgan Stanley managed futures fund.
Furthermore, the S&P 500 Index and the Barclay CTA Index reflect the volatility and risk of loss characteristics of a broadly diversified equity portfolio and universe of commodity trading advisors, respectively. The performance results of any Morgan Stanley managed futures fund will be different from the performance of the Barclay CTA Index.
The futures and forward markets are fundamentally different from the securities markets in that for every gain in futures and forward trading, there is an equal and offsetting loss. If a managed futures fund does not perform in a manner non-correlated with the general financial markets or does not perform successfully, investors will obtain no diversification benefits by investing in such fund.
The performance information of the asset classes above does not reflect the effect of fees identical to those to be paid by the partnerships, including management, incentive, and brokerage fees. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Note that while the Barclay CTA Index reflects results net of actual fees and expenses, it includes accounts with trading advisors and fee structures that differ from public managed futures funds (such as the partnerships). Also, the partnerships' trading strategies may be different from the trading strategies employed by the trading advisors included in the Barclay CTA Index. Accordingly, while the Barclay CTA Index is believed to be representative of managed futures in general, the performance of public managed futures funds as a subclass, or individually (in particular, the partnerships), may differ.
