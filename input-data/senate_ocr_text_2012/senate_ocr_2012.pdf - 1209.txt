partnership's trading activities during each period. Until September 30, 2006, the trading advisor for Charter WCM was Millburn Ridgefield Corporation, and until September 15, 2006, the trading advisor for Charter Aspect was VK Capital Inc. It is important to note, however, that each trading advisor trades in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the trading advisor(s) or will be profitable in the future. Consequently, the results of operations of each partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of its trading advisor's trading activities on behalf of the -partnership during the period in question. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
The partnerships' results of operations set forth in the financial statements (see the financial ("F-") pages of this prospectus) are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements, including the following: The contracts the partnerships, trade are accounted for on a trade-date basis and marked to market on a daily basis. The difference between their cost and market value is recorded on the Statements of Operations as "Net change in unrealized trading profit (loss)" for open (unrealized) contracts, and recorded as "Realized trading profit (loss)" when open positions are closed out. The sum of these amounts, along with the "Proceeds from Litigation Settlement", constitutes the partnerships' trading results. The market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day. The value of a foreign currency forward contract is based on the spot rate as of the close of business. Interest income, as well as management fees, incentive fees, and brokerage fees expenses of the partnerships are recorded on an accrual basis.
The general partner believes that, based on the nature of the operations of the partnerships, no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts.
Results of Operations for Morgan Stanley Charter Graham L.P.
2007 Results. The most significant trading gains of approximately 8.2% were recorded in the global interest rate sector, primarily during January, April, May, and June from short positions in European and U.S. interest rate futures as prices trended lower amid solid economic data, rising equity prices, and surging home prices in the United Kingdom and the United States, which reduced demand for the "safe haven" of fixed-income investments. Further gains were recorded during November from newly established long positions in European and U.S. fixed-income futures as prices increased following a sharp decline in global equity markets and forecasts of deeper losses related to sub-prime investments, which fueled speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England might need to reduce borrowing costs in response to widespread fears of an economic decline. Within the currency sector, gains of approximately 7.0% were experienced primarily during April, May, and June from short positions in the U.S. dollar versus most of its major rivals, notably the Turkish lira, Brazilian real, euro, and Canadian dollar, as the value of the U.S. dollar declined relative to these currencies amid news that foreign central banks had diversified their currency holdings to non-U.S. dollar-denominated assets and fears that an economic slowdown in the United States might lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Meanwhile, the value of the Canadian dollar, also known as a "commodity currency", moved higher in the wake of consistently rising commodity prices. During September and October, the value of the U.S. dollar continued to decline against the aforementioned currencies leading up to and after the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to reduce its benchmark interest rate to 4.5%, as well as on indications for further rate reductions in the near-term. Within the energy markets, gains of approximately 1.2% were experienced primarily during June, July, September, October, and December from long futures positions in crude oil and its related products as prices trended higher due to persistent concerns that instability in Iraq and tension regarding Iran's nuclear program might negatively affect global supply. In addition, energy prices increased due to continued weakness in the value of the U.S. dollar as U.S. dollar-denominated assets became more attractive
