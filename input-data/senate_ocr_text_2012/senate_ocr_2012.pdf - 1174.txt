Major Conflicts of Interest
•	Because the general partner, the commodity brokers and the foreign currency forward and options counterparties are affiliates, the fees and other compensation received by those parties and the other terms relating to the operation of the partnerships and the sale of units were not negotiated by an independent party.
•	Because your Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated financial advisor receives a portion of the brokerage fees paid by the partnerships, your financial advisor has a conflict of interest in advising you in the purchase or redemption of units.
•	The trading advisors, commodity brokers, foreign currency forward and options counterparties and general partner may trade futures, forwards, and options for their own accounts and, thus, they may compete with a partnership for positions. Also, the other commodity pools managed by the general partner and the trading advisors compete with the partnerships for positions. These conflicts can result in less favorable prices on the partnerships' transactions.
The General Partner
The general partner for each partnership is Demeter Management Corporation, a Delaware corporation. The general partner is or has been the commodity pool operator for 38 commodity pools. As of February 29, 2008, the general partner managed $3.1 billion of client assets. The general partner's address is 522 Fifth Avenue, 13th Floor, New York, New York 10036, telephone (212) 296-1999.
The Commodity Brokers
The commodity brokers for the partnerships are responsible for holding the partnerships' funds deposited with them as margin for trades and for assuring that the partnerships' trades are properly processed and recorded or "cleared" by the clearinghouse affiliated with the exchange on which the trade took place.
Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, an affiliate of the general partner, serves as the commodity broker for each partnership, with the exception of trades on the London Metal Exchange, which are cleared by Morgan Stanley & Co. International pic, also an affiliate of the general partner. In addition, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated acts as the counterparty on all of the foreign currency forward trades for the partnerships. To the extent a trading advisor trades options on foreign currency forward trades for a partnership, Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc., an affiliate of the general partner, will act as the counterparty on all such options on foreign currency forward trades. Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. is a company guaranteed by its parent company, Morgan Stanley, that engages only in activities that do not require registration with any federal or state regulatory authority.
