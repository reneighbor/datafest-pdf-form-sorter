other rights of the Partnership or the General Partner, will cause the amount of the obligation to be debited against the Capital Account of the Partner when the Partnership pays the obligation, and any amounts then or in the future distributable to the Partner will be reduced by the amount of the taxes. If the amount of the taxes is greater than any distributable amounts, then the Partner and any successor to the Partner's Units will pay to the Partnership as a Capital Contribution, upon demand by the General Partner, the amount of the excess. A General Partner will not be obligated to apply for or obtain a reduction of or exemption from withholding tax on behalf of any Partner that may be eligible for the reduction or exemption, except that, in the event that the General Partner determines that a Partner is eligible for a refund of any withholding tax, the General Partner may, at the request and expense of the Partner, assist the Partner in applying for such refund.
(b) Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement and unless prohibited by the 1940 Act, any expenditures payable by the Partnership, to the extent determined by the General Partner to have been paid or withheld on behalf of, or by reason of particular circumstances applicable to, one or more but fewer than all of the Partners, will be charged to only those Partners on whose behalf the payments are made or whose particular circumstances gave rise to such payments. The charges will be debited from the Capital Accounts of the Partners as of the close of the Fiscal Period during which the items were paid or accrued by the Partnership.

The General Partner may increase or reduce any reserves from time to time by amounts as it in its sole discretion deems necessary or appropriate. The amount of any reserve, or any increase or decrease in a reserve, will be proportionately charged or credited to the Capital Accounts of those Persons who or that are Partners at the time the reserve is created, or increased or decreased, except that if any individual reserve item, adjusted by any increase in the item, exceeds the lesser of $500,000 or 1% of the aggregate value of the Units of all of those Partners, then the amount of the reserve, increase or decrease may instead, at the discretion of the General Partner, be charged or credited to the Capital Accounts of those Persons who or that were Partners at the time, as determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion, of the act or omission giving rise to the contingent liability for which the reserve was established, increased or decreased in proportion to their Capital Accounts.
(b) If any amount is required by Section 5.5(a) of this Agreement to y^	be charged or credited to a Person who or that is no longer a Partner, the amount will be
paid by or to the party, in cash, with interest from the date on which the General Partner ®	determines that the charge or credit is required. In the case of a charge, the former Partner
WJ	will be obligated to pay as a Capital Contribution the amount of the charge, plus interest as
g	provided in this Section 5.5(b), to the Partnership on demand, except that (1) in no event
