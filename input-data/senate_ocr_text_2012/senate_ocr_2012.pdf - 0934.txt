Ability of Underlying Funds to Finance, Consummate and Dispose of Investments: The Investment Funds' ability to generate attractive investment returns for their investors may be adversely affected to the extent the Investment Funds are unable to obtain favorable financing terms for their real estate investments and may also affect certain of our private equity real estate fund of funds' and the Investment Funds' ability to exit the investment. Certain marketplace events may have an adverse impact on the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to an overall weakening of the global economies. Certain economic downturns could adversely affect the financial resources of corporate borrowers in which the Investment Funds have invested, in addition to the resources of operating partners and investment projects in which the Investment Funds participate, and result in the inability of such borrowers, partners and projects to make principal and interest payments on outstanding debt when due. In the event of such defaults, the Investment Funds may suffer a partial or total loss of capital invested in such companies, which could, in turn, have an adverse effect on the Investment Funds' and certain of our private equity real estate fund of funds' returns. Such marketplace events also may restrict the ability of the Investment Funds to sell or liquidate real estate investments at favorable times or for favorable prices.
We do not recommend a particular type of security, but generally recommend a fund of funds investment approach. The risks associated with a fund of fund investment approach are discussed more fully in Item 8B above.
