discretion to effectuate such offerings. At each such closing, the Partnership shall issue and sell Units to each subscriber whose subscription shall be accepted by the General Partner at a price per Unit to be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the offering price per Unit at the closing during any offering of Units shall not at any time be less than the Net Asset Value of a Unit as of the close of business on the date of the applicable closing at which such Unit shall be issued and sold, unless the newly offered Units' participation in the Partnership's profits and losses is proportionately reduced. During any offering, Units may be subscribed for by the General Partner, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, Morgan Stanley, any trading advisor to the Partnership (each, a "Trading Advisor"), any commodity broker for the Partnership (each, a "Commodity Broker"), and such persons' respective shareholders, directors, officers, partners, employees, principals, and Affiliates. Subscriptions for Units by such persons shall not preclude them from receiving compensation from the Partnership for services rendered by them in their respective capacities as other than Limited Partners. No subscriber for Units during any offering of Units shall become a Limited Partner until the General Partner shall: (a) accept such subscriber's subscription at a closing relating to such offering; (b) execute this Agreement on behalf of such subscriber pursuant to the power of attorney in the subscription agreement executed by the subscriber in connection with such offering; and (c) make an entry on the books and records of the Partnership reflecting that such subscriber has been admitted as a Limited Partner. Accepted subscribers shall be deemed Limited Partners at such time as their admission shall be reflected on the books and records of the Partnership. The aggregate of all capital contributions to the Partnership shall be available to the Partnership to carry on its business and no interest shall be paid by the Partnership on any such contribution.
In connection with any offering of Units by the Partnership, the General Partner, on behalf of the Partnership, shall: (a) cause to be filed one or more disclosure documents and such amendments and supplements thereto as the General Partner shall deem advisable or as may be required by applicable law with the CFTC and the National Futures Association ("NFA"), Forms D or other applications, notices or forms with the SEC and state securities and Blue Sky administrators, and Registration Statements, Prospectuses (as used hereinafter, the term "Prospectus" shall mean the most recent version of the Prospectus issued by the Partnership, or the most recent version of the disclosure document or other offering memorandum prepared, in connection with the particular offering of Units), and such amendments and supplements thereto as the General Partner shall deem advisable or as may be required by applicable law, with the CFTC, the NFA, the SEC, and NASD Regulation, Inc.; (b) qualify by registration or exemption from registration the Units for sale under the Blue Sky and securities laws of such states of the United States and such other jurisdictions as the General Partner in its sole discretion shall deem advisable or as may be required by applicable law; (c) make such arrangements for the sale of Units as it shall deem advisable, including engaging Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, or any other firm as Selling Agent and entering into a selling agreement with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, or such other Selling Agent; and (d) take such action with respect to and in order to effectuate the matters described in clauses (a) through (c) as it shall deem advisable or necessary.
The Partnership shall not pay the costs of any offering or any selling commissions relating thereto. No Limited Partner shall have any preemptive, preferential or other rights with respect to the issuance or sale of any additional Units, except as described in the applicable Prospectus. No Limited Partner shall have the right to consent to the admission of any additional Limited Partner. There is no maximum aggregate amount of contributions which may be received by the Partnership.
All Units subscribed for shall be issued subject to the collection of good funds. If, at any time, good funds representing payment for Units are not made available to the Partnership because a subscriber has provided bad funds in the form of a bad check or draft or otherwise to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, or another Selling Agent which, in turn, has deposited the subscription amount with the escrow agent, the Partnership shall cancel the Units issued to such subscriber represented by such bad funds, and the subscriber's name shall be removed as a Limited Partner from the books and records of the Partnership. Any losses or profits sustained by the Partnership in connection with its Futures Interests trading allocable to such cancelled Units shall be deemed a decrease or increase in Net Assets and allocated among the remaining Partners as described in Section 7. Each Limited Partner agrees to reimburse the Partnership for any expense or loss (including any trading loss) incurred in connection with the issuance and cancellation of any such Units issued to such Limited Partner.
