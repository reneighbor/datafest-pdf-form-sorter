Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners LP is registered as a CPO and MSIM is registered as a CPO and a CTA
We are an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley, a publicly traded company. On September 21, 2008, Morgan Stanley obtained approval to become a BHC under the BHCA upon the conversion of its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Morgan Stanley Bank, from a Utah industrial bank to a national bank. Concurrent with this conversion, Morgan Stanley became an FHC under the BHCA, which is a status available to BHC's that meet certain criteria. As such, Morgan Stanley is subject on a worldwide basis to regulation, examination and supervisions by the U.S. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Morgan Stanley may need to take actions to comply with banking regulations that apply to it even though such action may adversely affect the Funds and pose a conflict of interest with investors.
Conflict Identification:
We, along with Morgan Stanley, have established procedures intended to identify and mitigate conflicts of interest related to business activities on a worldwide basis. A conflict management officer for each business unit and/or region acts as a focal point'to identify and address potential conflicts of interest in their business area. When appropriate, there is an escalation process to senior management within the business unit, and ultimately if necessary to firm management or the firm's franchise committees, for potentially significant conflicts that cannot be resolved by the conflict management officers or that otherwise require senior management review. If you invest in our Funds, we address conflicts through disclosure we provide to you and should any transactions presenting a potential conflict of interest actually arise, we may in certain situations choose to seek the approval of the Advisory Committee with respect to conflicts of interest or approvals required under the Advisers Act, including Section 206(3) thereunder. We may also choose to seek the approval of the limited partners in the applicable Fund with respect to certain conflict situations or matters under the Advisers Act.
Item 11 - Code of Ethics, Participation or Interest in Client Transactions and Personal Trading
Personal Trading:
We have adopted a Code of Ethics (the "Code") pursuant to Rule 204A-1 under the Advisers Act. Each of our employees is required to acknowledge the Code at the inception of his/her employment and annually thereafter. The Code is designed to make * certain that all acts, practices and courses of business engaged in by our employees are conducted in accordance with the highest possible standards and to prevent abuse, or even the appearance of abuse, by employees with respect to their personal trading and other business activities.
The Code requires all employees to pre-clear trades for covered securities, as defined under the Code, in a personal account. A pre-clearance request will be denied if there is an open order for a client in the same security. The Code also imposes holding periods
