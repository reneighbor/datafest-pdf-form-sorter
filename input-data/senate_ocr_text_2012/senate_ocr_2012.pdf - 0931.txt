returns if an Investment Fund ears a greater return on the investments purchased with borrowed funds than it pays of the use of those funds, the use of leverage will decrease the return on an Investment Fund if the Investment Fund fails to earn as much on investments purchased with borrowed funds as it pays for the use of those funds. The use of leverage will in this way magnify the volatility of changes in the value of an investment in the Investment Funds.
Distressed Securities: Certain of the companies in whose securities the Investment Funds may invest may be in transition, out of favor, financially leveraged or troubled, or potentially troubled, and may be or have recently been involved in major strategic actions, restructurings, bankruptcy, reorganization or liquidation. These characteristics of these companies can cause their securities to be particularly risky, although they also may offer the potential for high returns. These companies' securities may be considered speculative, and the ability of the companies to pay their debts on schedule could be affected by adverse interest rate movements, changes in the general economic climate, economic factors affecting a particular industry or specific developments within the companies. An Investment Fund's investment in any instrument is subject to no minimum credit standard and a significant portion of the obligations and preferred stock in which an Investment Fund may invest may be less than investment grade (commonly referred to as junk bonds), which may result in the Investment Fund's experiencing greater risks than it would if investing in higher rated instruments.
Short Sales: An Investment Fund may attempt to limit its exposure to a possible market decline in the value of its portfolio securities through short sales of securities that its Investment Manager believes possess volatility characteristics similar to those being hedged. An Investment Fund may also use short sales for non-hedging purposes to pursue its investment objectives if, in the Investment Manager's view, the security is over-valued in relation to the issuer's prospects for earnings growth. Short selling is speculative in nature and, in certain circumstances, can substantially increase the effect of adverse price movements on an Investment Fund's portfolio. A short sale of a security involves the risk of an unlimited increase in the market price of the security that can in turn result in an inability to cover the short position and a theoretically unlimited loss. No assurance can be given that securities necessary to cover an Investment Fund's short position will be available for purchase.
Private Equity Fund of Funds Generally:
Buy-Out Transactions: Certain of our private equity fund of funds may invest directly, or indirectly through Investment Funds, in leveraged buyouts that by their nature require companies to undertake a high ratio of leverage to available income. Leveraged investments are inherently more sensitive to declines in revenues and to increases in expenses.
Control Positions: Certain of our private equity fund of funds may directly, or indirectly through Investment Funds, take control positions in companies. The exercise of control over a company imposes additional risks of liability for environmental damage, product defects, failure to supervise and other types of related liability. If such liabilities were to
