different from the trading strategies employed by the trading advisors included in the Barclay CTA Index and the public managed futures funds included in the CASAM CISDM Public CPO Asset Weighted Index. Accordingly, while the Barclay CTA Index is believed to be representative of managed futures in general, and the CASAM CISDM Public CPO Asset Weighted Index is believed to be representative of public managed futures funds in general, the performance of the partnerships may differ from the performance reflected in such indices.
Correlation to Traditional Investments
Managed futures have historically demonstrated the ability to perform independently of traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds. This is referred to as non-correlation, or the potential for managed futures to perform when traditional markets such as stocks and bonds may experience difficulty performing. Of course, managed futures funds will not automatically be profitable during unfavorable periods for these traditional investments, and vice versa. The degree of non-correlation of any given managed futures fund will vary, particularly as a result of market conditions, and some funds will have a significantly lesser degree of non-correlation (i.e., greater correlation) with stocks and bonds than others. To the extent the performance of managed futures and the performance of traditional markets are non-correlated, managed futures may or may not perform as well when the traditional markets are performing well.
The factors that influence the stock and bond markets can affect the futures markets in different ways and to varying degrees. In this connection, an article in the June 8,1998 issue of Business Week, "Commodities Are Cheap — Time to Leap?" discusses the risks and potential rewards of investing in managed futures funds, noting the low correlation of their performance to stocks and bonds.
Correlation measures how closely related two data series are, in this case, returns on asset classes. More specifically, the correlation coefficient measures the direction and extent of the linear relationship between two data series. Correlation coefficient values range from 1 to -1. A value greater than 0 implies a positive linear relationship {positive correlation). A value less than 0 implies an inverse linear relationship {negative correlation). A value of 0 implies no linear relationship (no correlation). The following tables and charts were prepared by the general partner to illustrate the correlation coefficient of each partnership's performance results to those of the S&P 500 Index and the Citigroup Corporate Bond Index for the periods specified. A pro forma of the trading program for Charter WCM and a pro forma of the trading program for Charter Aspect were included because each partnership has a new trading advisor effective December 1, 2006 and the performance history of each partnership is based in part on the trading performance of prior trading advisors. The performance results of the pro forma used for Charter WCM were prepared by the general partner based on the composite performance results of the trading advisor in trading assets pursuant to the Winton Diversified Trading Program used in Charter WCM. The pro forma reflects adjustments made for the interest income, brokerage, management and incentive fees payable by Charter WCM, and was made in the same manner as the pro forma performance results of the Winton Diversified Trading Program on page 84 in Capsule B. The performance results of the pro forma used for Charter Aspect were prepared by the general partner based upon the gross trading results of a representative account (as provided by Aspect), an account traded pursuant to the Aspect Diversified Program used in Charter Aspect. The pro forma reflects adjustments made for the brokerage, management and incentive fees payable by Charter Aspect, and was made in the same manner as the pro forma performance results of the representative account of the representative account on page 94 in Capsule B. The charts also show the number of months the monthly returns of the partnerships were positive or negative with, or different from, the monthly returns of these two indices. Investors are cautioned that the performance information set forth in the following charts is not necessarily indicative of, and may have no bearing on, any trading results that may be attained by a partnership in the future.
