Each partnership's fees and expenses are subject to limits imposed under guidelines applied by certain state securities regulators, as set forth in Section 7(e) of the limited partnership agreement, including the limitation that the aggregate of the brokerage fees payable by the partnership to any commodity broker and the net excess interest and compensating balance benefits to any commodity broker, after crediting the partnership with interest, shall not exceed 14% annually of the partnership's average month-end net assets during the calendar year. The general partner will pay any fees and expenses in excess of any such limits.
Redemption Charges
You may redeem all or part of your investment in any partnership at any month-end once you have been an investor in the partnership for at least six months, regardless of when your units were actually purchased.
Units redeemed on or before the last day of the twelfth month after they were purchased are subject to a redemption charge equal to 2% of the net asset value of the unit on the redemption date. Units redeemed after the last day of the twelfth month and on or before the last day of the twenty-fourth month after they were purchased are subject to a redemption charge equal to 1% of the net asset value of the units on the redemption date. If you redeem units after the last day of the twenty-fourth month after they were purchased, you will not be subject to a redemption charge. All redemption charges will be paid to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and will not be shared with the financial advisor or additional selling agent who sold the units.
The following is an example of a redemption charge that may be payable by you to the commodity broker. If you redeem $20,000 worth of units in a partnership after the sixth month and on or before the last day of the twelfth month after the units were purchased, you will be subject to the full 2% redemption charge. In that case, an aggregate redemption charge equal to $400 (2% of $20,000) will be deducted from the proceeds of your redemption.
USE OF PROCEEDS
Each partnership engages in the speculative trading of futures, forward, and options contracts. The proceeds received by each partnership from the sale of its units and the continuing capital contributions made by the general partner to each partnership will be deposited in commodity trading accounts established by the commodity brokers for the partnership. All of the funds in a partnership's trading accounts will be used to engage in trading futures, forward, and options contracts.
The partnerships' assets held by Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated will be segregated or secured in accordance with the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations. The partnerships' trading on various U.S. futures exchanges is subject to CFTC regulation and the rules of the exchanges. The partnerships' trading on non-U.S. futures exchanges is subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulatory authorities and the rules of the exchanges.
Each partnership's margin commitments with respect to its U.S. commodity futures and forward positions have ranged, and are anticipated to range, between 10% and 40% of net assets. However, a partnership's margin levels could deviate substantially from that range in the future.
