Footnotes to Capsule B Pro Forma Performance Summary
Capsule B above reflects pro forma rates of return, which are the result of the general partner making certain pro forma adjustments to the gross trading results of a representative account (as provided by Aspect) traded pursuant to the Aspect Diversified Program to be used in Charter Aspect. The pro forma adjustments are an attempt to approximately reflect Charter Aspect's brokerage, management and incentive fees as opposed to the fees and expenses, applicable to the representative account included in Capsule A above. The pro forma capsule reflects the actual interest earned by the representative account, not the interest income to be earned by Charter Aspect.
Capsule B must be read in conjunction with the description of Aspect and its trading program above. Furthermore, you must be aware that pro forma rates of return have certain inherent limitations: pro forma adjustments are only an approximate means of modifying historical records to reflect certain aspects of the economic terms of Charter Aspect, constitute no more than mathematical adjustments to actual performance numbers, and give no effect whatsoever to such factors as possible changes in trading approach that might have resulted from the different fee structure, and other factors applicable to Charter Aspect as compared to the representative account traded pursuant to the Aspect Diversified Program. The general partner believes that the method used above provides a fair representation of the pro forma effect of the different fees, and expenses on the representative trading results.
While the general partner believes that the information set forth in Capsule B is relevant to evaluating an investment in Charter Aspect, no representation is or could be made that Capsule B presents what the results of Charter Aspect would have been in the past or are likely to be in the future. Past results are not a guarantee of future results.
