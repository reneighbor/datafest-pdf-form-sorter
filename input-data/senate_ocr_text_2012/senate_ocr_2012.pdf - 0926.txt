will not consent to any transfer or other disposition that could cause the Fund to be treated as a "publicly traded partnership" under the Internal Revenue Code. There is currently no market for the interests, and it is not contemplated that one will develop. You should only acquire interests if you are able to commit your funds for an indefinite period of time.
Absence of Regulatory Oversight. Certain of the Funds and the Investment Funds are not registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act. Certain of our Funds, as investors in these Investment Funds, do not have the benefit of the protections afforded by the 1940 Act to investors in registered investment companies. In addition, the Investment Managers of the Investment Funds often are not registered as investment advisers under the Advisers Act. Although we periodically receive information from each Investment Fund regarding its investment performance and investment strategy, we may have little or no means of independently verifying this information. An Investment Fund may use proprietary investment strategies that are not fully disclosed to us, which may involve risks under some market conditions that are not anticipated by us. Investment Managers may change their investment strategies (i.e., may experience style drift) at any time. In addition, we have no direct control over any Investment Funds' investment management, brokerage, custodial arrangements or operations and must rely on the experience and competency of the Investment Manager in these areas. The performance of our Funds depends on our success in selecting Investment Funds for investment by the Funds and the allocation and reallocation of assets among those Investment Funds.
The Investment Funds typically do not maintain their securities and other assets in the custody of a bank or a member of a securities exchange, as generally required of registered investment companies. It is anticipated that the Investment Funds in which the Funds invest generally will maintain custody of their assets with brokerage firms that do not separately segregate such customer assets as required in the case of registered investment companies. Under the provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, as amended, the bankruptcy of any such brokerage firm could have a greater adverse effect on the Funds than would be the case if custody of assets were maintained in accordance with the requirements applicable to registered investment companies. There is also a risk that an Investment Manager could convert assets committed or paid to it by the Funds for its own use or that a custodian could convert assets committed to it by an Investment Manager to its own use.
Each Investment Manager may receive any incentive-based fees to which it is entitled irrespective of the performance of the other Investment Funds and the Fund generally. As a result, an Investment Manager with positive performance may receive compensation from the Fund, in the form of the asset-based fees, incentive-based fees and other expenses payable by the Account as an investor in the relevant Investment Fund, even if the Fund's overall returns are negative. The investment decisions of the Investment Funds are made by the Investment Managers independently of each other so that, at any particular time, one Investment Fund may be purchasing shares in an issuer that at the same time are being sold by another Investment Fund. Transactions of this sort could result in a Fund directly or indirectly incurring certain transaction costs without accomplishing any net investment result, which may result in the pursuit of opposing
