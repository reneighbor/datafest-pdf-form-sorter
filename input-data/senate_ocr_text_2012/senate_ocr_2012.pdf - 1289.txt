transaction, even if such contracts are not otherwise treated as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes and solicited comments with respect to the appropriate methodology, scope and other tax issues associated with such transactions, including appropriate transition and effective dates. It is possible that any guidance that is adopted may extend to certain contracts as described herein, in which case a U.S. holder may be required to accrue ordinary income over the term of such contracts. If the partnership were to invest in prepaid forward or financial contracts, a limited partner could be required to accrue ordinary income over the term of such contracts pursuant to future guidance adopted by the Internal Revenue Service. The Internal Revenue Service has also issued Revenue Ruling 2008-1, in which it ruled that prepaid forward contracts or exchange-traded notes that reference a single foreign currency, but which are purchased and redeemed in U.S. dollars, will be treated as indebtedness for tax purposes. If the partnership were to invest in contracts addressed by Revenue Ruling 2008-1, a limited partner would be required to accrue ordinary income over the term of the contracts.
Taxation of Non-U.S. Limited Partners. A nonresident alien individual, non-U.S. corporation, or non-U.S. partnership {a "non-U.S. limited partner") generally should not be deemed to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business solely by virtue of an investment in the partnerships; provided that such non-U.S. limited partner is not a "dealer" in commodities and, in the case of an individual, does not have certain present or former connections with the U.S. (e.g., is not present in the U.S. more than 182 days during his or her taxable year, or, in certain limited circumstances, a prior taxable year) and provided further, that such non-U.S. limited partner is not engaged in a trade or business within the U.S. during the taxable year or, in certain limited circumstances, a prior taxable year to which income, gain, or loss from the partnerships is treated as "effectively connected." Capital gains earned by the partnerships and allocated to such a non-U.S. limited partner will, as a general rule, not be subject to U.S. federal income taxation or withholding, but may be subject to taxation by the jurisdiction in which the non-U.S. limited partner is resident, organized or operating. In the event that a partnership were found to be engaged in a U.S. trade or business, a non-U.S. limited partner would be required to file a U.S. income tax return for such year and pay tax at full U.S. rates. In the case of a non-U.S. limited partner which is a non-U.S. corporation, an additional 30% "branch profits" tax might be imposed. Furthermore, in such event the partnerships would be required to withhold taxes from the income or gain allocable to such a non-U.S. limited partner under Section 1446 of the Code.
A non-U.S. limited partner is not subject to U.S, tax on certain interest income, including income attributable to (i) original issue discount on Treasury bills that have a maturity of 183 days or less or (ii) commercial bank deposits, provided, in either case, that such non-U.S. limited partner is not engaged in a trade or business within the U.S. during a taxable year. Additionally, a non-U.S. limited partner not engaged in a trade or business within the U.S. is generally not subject to U.S. tax on interest income (other than certain so-called "contingent interest") attributable to obligations issued after July 18,1984 that are in registered form if the non-U.S. limited partner timely provides the relevant partnership with a correct, complete and executed IRS Form W-8BEN.
Prospective non-U.S. limited partners who are engaged in a U.S. trade or business or who act as dealers in commodities may be subject to U.S. income tax and should consult their tax advisors before investing in a partnership.
The estate of a deceased non-U.S. limited partner may be liable for U.S. estate tax and may be required to obtain an estate tax release from the Internal Revenue Service in order to transfer the units of such non-U.S. limited partner.
Non-U.S. persons should consult their own tax advisors before deciding whether to invest in the partnerships.
Tax Elections. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, provides for optional adjustments to the basis of partnership property upon distributions of partnership property to a
