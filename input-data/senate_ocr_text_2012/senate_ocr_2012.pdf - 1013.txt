HATTERAS CORE ALTERNATIVES FUND, L.P. HATTERAS CORE ALTERNATIVES TEI FUND, L.P.
PROSPECTUS October 27, 2011 As amended January 1, 2012
LIMITED PARTNERSHIP UNITS
Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund, L.P. (formerly, the "Hatteras Multi-Strategy Fund, L.P.") and the Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Fund, L.P. (formerly, the "Hatteras Multi-Strategy TEI Fund, L.P.") are Delaware limited partnerships that are each registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as non-diversified, closed-end management investment companies. The Hatteras Core Alternatives TEI Fund, L.P. (the "TEI Fund") is designed for investment primarily by tax-exempt and tax-deferred investors. Hatteras Investment Partners, LLC ("HIP"), an investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"), serves as the investment manager to the Master Fund (as defined below) (in such capacity, the "Investment Manager").
The investment objective of each of the Hatteras Core Alternatives Fund, L.P. (the "Core Alternatives Fund") and the TEI Fund (each a "Fund" and together, the "Funds") is to provide capital appreciation consistent with the return characteristic of the alternative investment portfolios of larger endowments. To achieve its objective, the Core Alternatives Fund provides its limited partners (each, a "Partner" and together, the "Partners") with access to a broad range of investment strategies, asset categories and independent trading advisers ("Advisers") and by providing overall asset allocation services typically available on a collective basis to larger institutions through an investment of substantially all of its assets in the Hatteras Master Fund, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Master Fund"), which is also registered under the 1940 Act and has the same investment objective as the Core Alternatives Fund.
The TEI Fund provides its Partners with access to a broad range of investment strategies and asset categories, Advisers and overall asset allocation services typically available on a collective basis to larger institutions through an investment of substantially all of the assets of the TEI Fund in the Hatteras Core Alternatives Offshore Fund, LDC (the "Offshore Fund"), a Cayman Islands limited duration company with the same investment objective as the TEI Fund. The Offshore Fund in turn invests substantially all of its assets in the Master Fund, which has the same investment objective as the TEI Fund and the Offshore Fund. The Offshore Fund serves solely as an intermediate entity through which the TEI Fund invests in the Master Fund. The Offshore Fund makes no independent investment decisions and has no investment or other discretion over the TEI Fund's investable assets.
The Offshore Fund is interposed between the TEI Fund and the Master Fund and serves as an intermediate entity so that any income generated by the Master Fund is not ultimately recognized by Partners in the TEI Fund as unrelated business taxable income ("UBTI"). The Offshore Fund is treated as a corporation under the taxation laws of the United States. Any income received by the Offshore Fund is distributed to the TEI Fund as dividend income. UBTI should therefore not flow through the Offshore Fund to the Partners of the TEI Fund. As a result, income earned by a Partner from its investment in the TEI Fund should not constitute UBTI provided that the Partner does not itself incur indebtedness to finance its investment in the TEI Fund. See "TAXES".
Although it is not required to do so, the Master Fund will seek to allocate its assets among at least 50 Advisers, generally through investments in a wide range of investment vehicles ("Adviser Funds," which includes exchange-traded funds ("ETFs"), hedge funds, private investment funds and other investment funds) managed by the Advisers or by placing assets in an account directly managed by the Adviser (each, an "Adviser Account"). A Fund cannot guarantee that its investment objective will be achieved or that the Master Fund's strategy of investing in the Adviser Funds will be successful. Investing in the Funds involves a heightened risk of significant loss. SEE "RISK FACTORS," "GENERAL RISKS" AND "SPECIAL RISKS OF FUND OF FUNDS STRUCTURE" BEGINNING ON PAGE 28.
