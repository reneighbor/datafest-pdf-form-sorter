Investing in Special Situations: Certain of our private equity fund of funds may invest directly, or indirectly through Investment Funds, in companies that are involved in (or are the target of) acquisition attempts or tender offers, or companies involved in work-outs, liquidations, spin-offs, reorganizations, bankruptcies and similar-transactions. In any investment opportunity involving these types of transactions, there exists the risk that the transaction will be unsuccessful, will take considerable time or will result in a distribution of cash or a new security, the value of which will be less than the purchase price to certain of our private equity fund of funds. As a result, certain of our private equity fund of funds may suffer a loss, which may be complete, on its investment.
Venture Capital Investments: Certain of our private equity fund of funds may directly, or indirectly through Investment Funds, make venture capital investments. Such investments involve a high degree of business and financial risk that can result in substantial losses. The most significant risks are the risks associated with investments in: (i) companies in an early stage of development or with little or no operating history; (ii) companies operating at a loss or with substantial fluctuations in operating results from period to period; and (iii) companies with the need for substantial additional capital to support or to achieve a competitive position.
Use of Hedging Instruments: Certain of our private equity fund of funds and Investment Funds may choose, but are not required, to engage in transactions designed to reduce the risk or to protect the value of their investments, including securities and currency hedging transactions.

Hedging against a decline in the value of a portfolio position does not eliminate fluctuations in the values of portfolio positions or prevent losses if the values of those positions decline, but establishes other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thus offsetting the decline in the portfolio positions' value. While these transactions may reduce the risks associated with an investment by certain of our private equity fund of funds or the Investment Funds, the transactions themselves entail risks that are different from those of the investments of certain of our private equity fund of funds or Investment Funds. The risks posed by these transactions include, but are not limited to, interest rate risk, market risk, the risk that these complex instruments and techniques will not be successfully evaluated, monitored or priced, the risk that counterparties will default on their obligations, liquidity risk and leverage risk. Changes in liquidity may result in significant, rapid and unpredictable changes in the prices for derivatives.
