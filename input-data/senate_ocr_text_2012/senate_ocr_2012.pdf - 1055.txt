The Master Fund's Valuation Procedures require the Investment Manager to take reasonable steps in light of all relevant circumstances to value the Master Fund's portfolio: The Investment Manager will consider such information, and may conclude in certain circumstances that the information provided by an Adviser does not represent the fair value of the Master Fund's interests in the Adviser Fund. Although redemptions of interests in Adviser Funds are subject to advance notice requirements, Adviser Funds will typically make available NAV information to holders which will represent the price at which, even in the absence of redemption activity, the Adviser Fund would have effected a redemption if any such requests had been timely made or if, in accordance with the terms of the Adviser Fund's governing documents, it would be necessary to effect a mandatory redemption. Following procedures adopted by the Boards and the Master Fund Board, the Investment Manager will consider whether it is appropriate, in light of all relevant circumstances, to value such interests at the NAV as reported by the Adviser at the time of valuation, or whether to adjust such value to reflect a premium or discount to NAV. In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and industry practice, the Master Fund may not always apply a discount in cases where there is no contemporaneous redemption activity in a particular Adviser Fund. In other cases, as when an Adviser Fund imposes extraordinary restrictions on redemptions, when other extraordinary circumstances exist, or when there have been no recent transactions in Adviser Fund interests, the Master Fund may determine that it is appropriate to apply a discount to the NAV of the Adviser Fund. Any such decision will be made in good faith, and subject to the review and supervision of the Master Fund Board.
The valuations reported by the Advisers, upon which the Master Fund calculates its month-end NAV and the NAV of each Master Fund interest, including each Fund's Master Fund interest, may be subject to later adjustment or revision, based on information reasonably available at that time. For example, any "estimated" values from Adviser Funds may be revised and fiscal year-end NAV calculations of the Adviser Funds may be audited by their independent auditors and may be revised as a result of such audits. Other adjustments may occur from time to time. Because such adjustments or revisions, whether increasing or decreasing the NAV of the Master Fund, and therefore the Funds, at the time they occur, relate to information available only at the time of the adjustment or revision, the adjustment or revision may not affect the amount of the repurchase proceeds of the Funds received by Partners who had their Units in the Funds repurchased at a NAV calculated prior to such adjustments and received their repurchase proceeds, subject to the ability of the Funds to adjust or recoup the repurchase proceeds received by Partners under certain circumstances. As a result, to the extent that such subsequently adjusted valuations from the Advisers or revisions to the NAV of an Adviser Fund adversely affect the Master Fund's NAV, and therefore the Funds' NAV, the outstanding Units may be adversely affected by prior repurchases to the benefit of Partners who had their Units repurchased at a NAV higher than the adjusted amount. Conversely, any increases in the NAV resulting from such subsequently adjusted valuations may be entirely for the benefit of the outstanding Units and to the detriment of Partners who previously had their Units repurchased at a NAV lower than the adjusted amount. The same principles apply to the purchase of Units. New Partners may be affected in a similar way.
The Valuation Procedures provide that, where deemed appropriate by the Investment Manager and consistent with the 1940 Act, investments in Adviser Funds may be valued at cost. Cost will be used only when cost is determined to best approximate the fair value of the particular security under consideration. For example, cost may not be appropriate when the Master Fund is aware of sales of similar securities to third parties at materially different prices or in other circumstances where cost may not approximate fair value (which could include situations where there are no sales to third parties). In such a situation, the Master Fund's investment will be revalued in a manner that the Investment Manager, in accordance with the Valuation Procedures, determines in good faith best reflects approximate market value. The Master Fund Board will be responsible for ensuring that the Valuation Procedures utilized by the Investment Manager are fair to the Master Fund and consistent with applicable regulatory guidelines.
To the extent the Investment Manager invests the assets of the Master Fund in securities or other instruments that are not investments in Adviser Funds, the Master Fund will generally value such assets as described below. Securities traded (1) on one or more of the U.S. national securities exchanges or the OTC Bulletin Board will be valued at their last sales price, and (2) on NASDAQ will be valued at the NASDAQ Official Closing Price ("NOCP"), at the close of trading on the exchanges or markets where such securities are traded for the business day as of which such value is being determined. Securities traded on NASDAQ for which the NOCP is not available will be valued at the mean between the closing bid and asked prices in this market. Securities traded on a foreign securities exchange generally will be valued at their closing prices on the exchange where such securities are primarily traded and translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate. If an event occurs between the close of the foreign exchange and the jtfll computation of the Master Fund's NAV that would materially affect the value of the security, the value of such a security will be te adjusted to its fair value. Except as specified above, the value of a security, derivative, or synthetic security that is not actively traded $$ on an exchange shall be determined by an unaffiliated pricing service that may use actual trade data or procedures using market indices, matrices, yield curves, specific trading characteristics of certain groups of securities, pricing models, or combinations of W these. The Investment Manager will monitor the value assigned to each security by the pricing service to determine if it believes the value assigned to a security is correct. If the Investment Manager believes that the value received from the pricing service is incorrect, jjl then the value of the security will be its fair value as determined in accordance with the Valuation Procedures.
q Debt securities will be valued in accordance with the Valuation Procedures, which generally provide for using a third-party H pricing system, agent, or dealer selected by the Investment Manager, which may include the use of valuations furnished by a pricing
