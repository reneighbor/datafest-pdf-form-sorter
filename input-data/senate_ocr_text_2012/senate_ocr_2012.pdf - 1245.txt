Graham Selective Trading Program
The Graham Selective Trading Program features a Graham trend system developed in 1997, which utilizes an appreciably different trading system than other Graham trend systems. The Graham Selective Trading Program trend system uses a mathematical model to identify certain price patterns that have very specific characteristics indicating a high probability that a significant directional move will occur. Although the Graham Selective Trading Program trend system does not trade against the market trend, this model should be distinguished from a true trend-following strategy inasmuch as it will only participate in specific types of market moves that meet the restrictive criteria of the model, typically requiring a substantial increase in volatility.
K4 Program
The K4 Program trend system was developed in 1998 and commenced trading operations in January 1999. Like the Graham Selective Trading Program trend system, the K4 Program trend system uses a mathematical model to identify certain price patterns that have very specific characteristics indicating that there is a high probability that a significant directional move will occur. The K4 Program trend system normally enters or exits a position only when a significant price and volatility spike takes place. It is designed to have a high percentage of winning trades and it normally maintains a neutral position in approximately 50% of the markets in the portfolio.
Multi-Trend Program
The Multi-Trend Program provides access through one single investment to all three individual Graham investment programs, including the trend system and other component strategies of each investment program. The Multi-Trend Program allocates 33.3% of its assets equally to each of the Global Diversified Program, the Graham Selective Trading Program, and the K4 Program. As market conditions or other circumstances change, Graham may alter the weightings of the individual programs and add or subtract other programs to the Multi-Trend Program, as it deems appropriate.
As part of each of its three investment programs, Graham utilizes the trend system or systems associated with the program as indicated above, but may also include shorter term trend systems as well as counter-trend trading systems and trading systems that do not seek to identify or follow price trends at all. Such systems generally are based on computerized mathematical models and rely primarily on technical rather than fundamental information as the basis for their trading decisions. In addition, Graham may include as a part of any investment program discretionary trading strategies that, unlike Graham's systematic trading strategies, determine trades subjectively on the basis of a Graham trader's personal assessment of trading data and trading experience. While Graham's core trend systems principally employ long-term strategies, other included systems and strategies may include short-term and medium-term trading as well.
Graham believes that the use of multiple trading systems and strategies for each account can diversify the management of a client's capital, enhance performance and reduce volatility and risk. Counter-trend systems, non-trend systems and other strategies may add value attributable to their low correlation to Graham's trend systems. Importantly, counter-trend systems, non-trend systems and other strategies may generate successful performance results in trading range type markets where there are few long-term trends.
Graham also expects to develop additional trading systems and strategies and to modify the systems currently in use over time. Graham believes strongly in the importance of research and development activities and particularly in the development of new trading strategies. The decision to add or subtract systems or strategies from any investment program shall be at the sole discretion of Graham. Clients will not be informed of these changes as they occur.
