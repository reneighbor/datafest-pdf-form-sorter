Item 2 - Material Changes
On July 28, 2010, the United State Securities and Exchange Commission published "Amendments to Form ADV" which amends the disclosure document that we provide to you as required by SEC rules. This Brochure is a new document prepared according to the SEC's new requirements and rules. As such, this document is materially different in structure and requires certain new information that we previously were not required to provide to you. Please note that this Brochure has been prepared for the purpose of complying with regulatory requirements and should not be deemed to be an offer of securities or investment advisory services.
In the future, this Item will set forth specific material changes that have been made to the Brochure and we will provide you with a summary of such changes. In the past, we have offered to provide you with information about our qualifications and business practices on at least an annual basis. Pursuant to new SEC rules, we will ensure that you receive a summary of any material changes to this and subsequent Brochures within 120 days of the close of our fiscal year. We will also provide other ongoing disclosure information about material changes as necessary.
We will provide you with a new Brochure as necessary based on changes or new information, at any time, without charge. Currently, the Brochure may be requested by contacting Mary Jane Maloney at 610.940.5113 or
maryiane.malonev@aiorganstanley.com.
Additional information about Morgan Stanley AIP GP LP is also available via the SEC's web site www.adviserinfo.sec.gov.
