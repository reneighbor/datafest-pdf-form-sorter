Investment in the Private Real Estate strategy consists generally of investing in Adviser Funds that are private partnerships that make direct investments in (i) existing or newly constructed income-producing properties, including office, industrial, retail, and multi-family residential properties, (ii) raw land, which may be held for development or for the purpose of appreciation, and/or (iii) timber (whether directly or through a REIT or other Adviser Fund).
Advisers whose Adviser Funds are private partnerships that invest in real estate typically offer the opportunity to generate high absolute returns, but without the liquidity offered by REITs. These Advisers will invest mainly in established properties with existing rent and expense schedules or in newly constructed properties with predictable cash flows or in which a seller agrees to provide certain minimum income levels. On occasion, these Advisers may invest in raw land, which may be acquired for appreciation or development purposes. These Advisers typically provide their investors with a current yield (generally from rental or lease income on properties) and will often seek to generate capital gains through the sale of properties. However, these Advisers often do not provide their investors with the right to redeem their investment in the Adviser Fund, thus the investors only gain liquidity in their investment though the distribution of rental income and the ultimate liquidation or sale of real estate assets held by the Adviser Fund.
Adviser Funds may additionally invest in foreign real estate or real estate-related investments. The Master Fund will consider the special risks involved in foreign investing before investing in foreign real estate and will not invest unless an underlying Adviser Fund has exhibited prior expertise in the foreign markets in which it invests.
Investment in the Private Energy and Natural Resources strategy consists generally of investing in Adviser Funds that are private partnerships that make direct investments in private or (sometimes) publicly traded energy companies. The types of companies included within the "energy" sector will include a diverse range of energy industry sectors, including: oilfield service and equipment manufacturing sectors, exploration and production, technology, pipelines and storage, and power generation and transmission. Securities issued by private partnerships investing in energy or natural resources may be more illiquid than securities issued by other Adviser Funds generally, because the partnerships' underlying energy and natural resources investments may tend to be less liquid than other types of investments. Also, Adviser Funds in the Private Energy and Natural Resources strategy may invest in other natural resources, such as timberlands, basic metals (e.g., iron, aluminum, and copper), precious metals (e.g. gold, silver, platinum and palladium) and other basic commodities.
OVERVIEW OF INVESTMENT PROCESS
MANAGER CRITERIA; PORTFOLIO CONSTRUCTION The Funds strive to maintain a broad allocation of their assets, both with regard to allocation of assets among Advisers and also allocation of assets among various investment strategies, as set forth below. In general, studies indicate that a broadly allocated portfolio enables an investor to generate more consistent returns than one that is more concentrated. Accordingly, a broad allocation of assets is generally noted as a means to reduce investment risk as measured by volatility. Correspondingly, while a broad allocation of assets generally lowers volatility and helps to mitigate the risk of investment losses, an unconcentrated portfolio is subject to limitations on its ability to generate relatively high investment returns than a more concentrated portfolio can sometimes generate. Accordingly, an unconcentrated portfolio may be appropriate for investors that want less volatility in their portfolio and are willing to accept relatively lower, but generally more consistent, returns than a portfolio concentrated in a very few investment strategies or Advisers.
In general, the Master Fund seeks to allocate its assets in two ways: (1) allocation among various investment strategies; and (2) allocation among Advisers. The Master Fund may allocate assets to more than one Adviser Fund sponsored by the same Adviser, such as in the event that an Adviser sponsors Adviser Funds in various investment strategies.
MANAGER DIVERSIFICATION. The Investment Manager defines "manager risk" as the risk that an Adviser will not generate the returns commensurate with the mean of the Adviser's peer group (e.g., same investment strategy and investment style) because of (a) poor fundamental analysis and/or security selection, (b) market timing, (c) management turnover within the Adviser or (d) other factors or circumstances that affect that Adviser's performance specifically that are not caused by market conditions within the Adviser's investment strategy generally. Manager risk may be reduced by, among other things, due diligence conducted on the Advisers and diversifying across multiple Advisers within the same or similar investment strategy.
Accordingly, the Investment Manager, on behalf of each Fund, generally attempts to allocate assets among multiple Advisers to achieve an appropriately broad allocation among investment strategies and also among Advisers. The Master Fund generally does not invest assets that, at the time invested, represent more than 5% of its net assets with any one Adviser Fund or 15% of its net assets with any family of funds known by the Investment Manager to be managed by the same Adviser. It is important to note, however, that the Master Fund may invest less than 5% of its net assets with an Adviser Fund or 15% of its assets with an Adviser, and through appreciation of the Adviser Fund or Funds or depreciation of the other Adviser Funds owned by the Master Fund, these limitations may be exceeded. In such a case, the Investment Manager will reduce the Master Fund's exposure to such Adviser Fund or Adviser, as the case may be, as soon as reasonably practicable. In addition, the Master Fund shall not invest capital, which at the time invested,
