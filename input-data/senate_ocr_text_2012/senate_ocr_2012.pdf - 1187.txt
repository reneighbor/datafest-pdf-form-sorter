The trading advisor for Charter Aspect may execute trades with affiliates.
The trading advisor of Charter Aspect may execute futures transactions with certain of its affiliates. The trading advisor has a conflict of interest in executing such trades because such affiliates will receive compensation in connection with each such transaction.
The lack of distributions increases the fees paid to affiliates of the general partner.
The general partner is responsible for determining whether and when to distribute trading profits earned by a partnership. Since the general partner currently does not intend to distribute trading profits, Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated as commodity broker will receive increased brokerage fees, because these fees are based upon the net asset value of a partnership, and net asset value will increase by retaining a partnership's trading profits.
Customer agreements with the commodity brokers permit actions which could result in losses or lost profit opportunity.
Under each customer agreement for a partnership, all funds, futures, forward, options, and securities positions, and credits carried for the partnership are held as security for its obligations to the commodity broker; the margins necessary to initiate or maintain open positions will be established by the commodity broker from time to time; and the commodity broker may close out positions, purchase futures, forwards, and options, or cancel orders at any time it deems necessary for its protection, without the consent of the partnership. For example, a commodity broker may determine to take any of these actions if prices in the futures markets are moving rapidly against a partnership's positions and the commodity broker is concerned that potential losses could exceed the partnership's assets such that the commodity broker would be left to incur the loss. While not a likely occurrence, it is possible for the trading advisors to believe that market conditions will . change and that existing positions or trades they wish to make would be profitable, such that the actions of the commodity broker preclude the partnership from engaging in profitable transactions or avoiding losses.
Each commodity broker or the general partner, or the investors in each partnership by majority vote, may terminate the brokerage relationship upon prior written notice.
