Redemption of a Limited Partner's Units shall be effective as of the last day of the first month ending after an irrevocable Request for Redemption in proper form shall have been received by the General Partner ("Redemption Date"); provided, that all liabilities, contingent or otherwise, of the Partnership (except any liability to Partners on account of their capital contributions) shall have been paid or there shall remain property of the Partnership sufficient to pay them. As used herein, "Request for Redemption" shall mean a letter in the form specified by the General Partner and received by the General Partner by 3:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the date on which such Redemption is to be effective. A form of Request for Redemption is annexed to this Agreement. Additional forms of Request for Redemption may be obtained by written request to the General Partner.
Upon Redemption, a Limited Partner (or any assignee thereof) shall receive from the Partnership for each Unit redeemed an amount equal to the Net Asset Value thereof as of the Redemption Date, less any redemption charges and any amount owing by such Partner (and his assignee, if any) to the Partnership pursuant to Section 14(d). If a Redemption is requested by an assignee, all amounts owed to the Partnership under Section 14(d) by the Partner to whom such Unit was sold, as well as all amounts owed by all assignees of such Unit, shall be deducted from the Net Asset Value of such Unit upon Redemption. The General Partner shall endeavor to pay Redemptions within 10 business days after the Redemption Date, except that under special circumstances (including, but not limited to, the inability on the part of the Partnership to liquidate Futures Interests positions or the default or delay in payments which shall be due the Partnership from commodity brokers, banks, or other persons), the Partnership may delay payment to Partners requesting Redemption of Units of the proportionate part of the Net Asset Value of the Units represented by the sums which are the subject of such default or delay. If the General Partner determines that the Partnership will be unable to pay any Redemption in full within 30 days after the applicable Redemption Date, the General Partner will send written notice to each redeeming Limited Partner, within 10 business days after the Redemption Date, of such inability to pay, the reason(s) therefor, and the anticipated date of payment, if known. Redemptions will be made by credit to the Limited Partner's customer account with Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated or by check mailed to the Limited Partner if such account is closed. The General Partner may, in its absolute discretion, waive any restrictions or charges applicable to redemptions.
The foregoing terms and conditions in this Section 10(b), other than those in the second paragraph hereof prohibiting redemptions before the sixth month-end following the closing at which a person first becomes a Limited Partner, shall also apply to redemptions effected on "Special Redemption Dates" held in accordance with Section 9,
The General Partner shall be authorized to execute, file, record, and publish, on behalf of the Partnership and each Partner, such amendments to this Agreement and such other documents as shall be necessary or desirable to reflect any Redemption pursuant to this Section 10(b),
(c) Exchange Privilege. Except as set forth below, a Limited Partner (or any assignee thereof) may redeem his Units effective as of the last business day of any month and authorize the General Partner to use the net proceeds of such redemption to purchase units of limited partnership interest of another Charter Series Partnership (such a transfer between Charter Series Partnerships being herein referred to as a "Series Exchange"). Series Exchanges shall only be permitted by a Limited Partner beginning as of, but not before, the sixth month-end following the closing at which a Limited Partner first became a limited partner of a Charter Series Partnership. The minimum amount of any Series Exchange is 100 Units, unless a Limited Partner is liquidating his entire interest in the other Charter Series Partnership.
A Series Exchange shall be effective as of the last business day of the month ending after an Exchange Agreement and Power of Attorney in proper form has been received by the General Partner ("Exchange Date"), provided, that the Partnership has assets sufficient to discharge its liabilities and to redeem Units on the Exchange Date. As used herein, "Exchange Agreement and Power of Attorney" shall mean the form annexed to the Prospectus as Exhibit B (or such other form as permitted by the General Partner), sent by a Limited Partner (or any assignee thereof) to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated branch office in time for it to be forwarded and received by the General Partner by 3:00 p.m. New York City time on the Exchange Date. Additional forms of the Exchange Agreement and Power of Attorney may be obtained by written request to the General Partner or from a local Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated branch office. Upon requesting a Series Exchange, a Limited Partner shall have authorized the General Partner to redeem the number of Units
