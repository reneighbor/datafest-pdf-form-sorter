12.	Withdrawal of Partners.
The Partnership shall terminate and be dissolved upon the withdrawal, insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation, or termination of the General Partner (unless a new general partner(s) is elected pursuant to Section 15(c) and such remaining general partner(s) shall have elected to continue the business of the Partnership, which any remaining general partner(s) shall have the right to do). The General Partner shall not withdraw or assign all of its interest at any time without giving the Limited Partners 120 days' prior written notice of its intention to withdraw or assign, and, if the Limited Partners thereupon elect a new general partner or partners pursuant to Section 15(c) which elect(s) to continue the business of the Partnership, the withdrawing General Partner shall pay all reasonable expenses incurred by the Partnership in connection with such withdrawal. The General Partner shall be paid the Net Asset Value of its interests in the Partnership as of the date of such withdrawal.
The death, incompetency, withdrawal, insolvency, bankruptcy, termination, liquidation, or dissolution of a Limited Partner shall not terminate or dissolve the Partnership, and such Limited Partner, his estate, custodian, or personal representative shall have no right to withdraw or value such Limited Partner's interest in the Partnership except as provided in Section 10. Each Limited Partner (and any assignee of such Partner's interest) expressly agrees that in the event of his death, he waives on behalf of himself and his estate and he directs the legal representative of his estate and any person interested therein to waive the furnishing of any inventory, accounting, or appraisal of the assets of the Partnership and any right to an audit or examination of the books of the Partnership (except to the extent permissible under the sixth paragraph of Section 8(e)).

Subject to Section 14, neither the General Partner, Morgan Stanley & Co, Incorporated, nor any Affiliate thereof shall be personally liable for the return or repayment of all or any portion of the capital or profits of any Partner (or assignee), it being expressly agreed that any such return of capital or profits made pursuant to this Agreement shall be made solely from the assets (which shall not include any right of contribution from the General Partner) of the Partnership.
14.	Standard of Liability; Indemnification.
(a)	Standard of Liability. The General Partner and its Affiliates shall not be liable to the Partnership, the Limited Partners, or its or their successors or assigns, for any act, omission, conduct or activity undertaken by or on behalf of the Partnership which the General Partner determines, in good faith, to be in the best interests of the Partnership, unless such act, omission, conduct, or activity constituted misconduct or negligence.
(b)	Indemnification by the Partnership. The Partnership shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the General Partner and its Affiliates from and against any loss, liability, damage, cost, or expense (including attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses incurred in defense of any demands, claims, or lawsuits) actually and reasonably incurred arising from any act, omission, activity, or conduct undertaken by or on behalf of the Partnership, including, without limitation, any demands, claims, or lawsuits initiated by a Limited Partner (or assignee thereof), provided that (1) the General Partner has determined, in good faith, that the act, omission, activity, or conduct giving rise to the claim for indemnification was in the best interests of the Partnership, and (2) the act, omission, activity, or conduct that was the basis for such loss, liability, damage, cost, or expense was not the result of misconduct or negligence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the foregoing, neither the General Partner nor any of its Affiliates nor any person acting as a broker-dealer shall be indemnified by the Partnership for any losses, liabilities, or expenses arising from or out of an alleged violation of federal or state securities laws unless (1) there has been a successful adjudication on the merits of each count involving alleged securities law violations as to the particular indemnitee, or (2) such claims have been dismissed with prejudice on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction as to the particular indemnitee, or (3) a court of competent jurisdiction approves a settlement of the claims against the particular indemnitee and finds that indemnification of the settlement and related costs should be made, provided, with regard to such court approval, the indemnitee must apprise the court of the position of the SEC, and the positions of the respective securities administrators of Massachusetts, Missouri, Tennessee, and/or those other states and jurisdictions in which the plaintiffs claim that they were offered or sold Units, with respect to indemnification for securities laws violations before seeking court
