INDUSTRY CONCENTRATION RISK. Adviser Funds generally are not subject to industry concentration restrictions on their investments and, in some cases, may invest 25% or more of the value of their total assets in a single industry or group of related industries. Although the Funds do not believe it is likely to occur given the nature of their investment program, it is possible that, at any given time, the assets of Adviser Funds in which the Master Fund has invested will, in the aggregate, be invested in a single industry or group of related industries constituting 25% or more of the value of their combined total assets. However, because these circumstances may arise, each Fund is subject to greater investment risk to the extent that a significant portion of its assets may at some times be invested, indirectly through investments the Master Fund makes in the Adviser Funds, in the securities of issuers engaged in similar businesses that are likely to be affected by the same market conditions and other industry-specific risk factors. Adviser Funds are not generally required to provide current information regarding their investments to their investors (including the Funds). Thus, the Funds and the Investment Manager may not be able to determine at any given time whether or the extent to which Adviser Funds, in the aggregate, have invested 25% or more of their combined assets in any particular industry.
REPURCHASE OFFERS; LIMITED LIQUIDITY; IN-KIND DISTRIBUTIONS. Each Fund will offer to purchase only a small portion of its Units (generally each quarter), and there is no guarantee that Partners will be able to sell all of the Units that they desire to sell in any particular repurchase offer. If a repurchase offer is oversubscribed, each Fund may repurchase only a pro rata portion of the Units tendered by each Partner. The potential for proration may cause some investors to tender more Units for repurchase than they wish to have repurchased.
The Core Alternatives Fund's assets consist primarily of its interest in the Master Fund. The TEI Fund's assets consist primarily of its interest in the Master Fund held through its investment in the Offshore Fund. Accordingly, the Funds will be required to liquidate a portion of their interest in the Master Fund in order to fund repurchases. In order to liquidate its interest in the Master Fund, the Offshore Fund (which is effectively controlled by the TEI Fund's Board) must accept repurchase orders made by the Master Fund and distribute the proceeds of such repurchases to the TEI Fund.
The Funds' repurchase policy will have the effect of decreasing the size of each Fund over time from what it otherwise would have been. Such a decrease may therefore force the Master Fund to sell assets it would not otherwise sell. It may also reduce the investment opportunities available to the Master Fund and cause its expense ratio to increase. In addition, because of the limited market for the Master Fund's private equity, real estate, venture capital and energy and natural resource investments, the Master Fund may be forced to sell its more liquid securities in order to meet cash requirements for repurchases. This may have the effect of substantially increasing the Master Fund's ratio of illiquid investments to liquid investments for the remaining investors.
Payment for repurchased Units may require the Master Fund to liquidate portfolio holdings earlier than the Investment Manager would otherwise want, potentially resulting in losses, and may increase the Master Fund's portfolio turnover, subject to such policies as may be established by the Board in an to attempt to avoid or minimize potential losses and turnover resulting from the repurchase of Units.
If a Partner tenders all of its Units (or a portion of its Units) in connection with a repurchase offer made by a Fund, that tender may not be rescinded by the Partner after the date on which the repurchase offer terminates. However, although the amount payable to the Partner will be based on the value of the Master Fund's assets as of the repurchase date, the value of Units that are tendered by Partners generally will not be determined until a date approximately one month later. Thus, a Partner will not know its repurchase price until after it has irrevocably tendered its Units.
LIMITED LIQUIDITY; IN-KIND DISTRIBUTIONS. Units in each Fund provide limited liquidity since Partners will not be able to redeem Units on a daily basis because the Funds are closed-end funds. A Partner may not be able to tender its interest in a Fund promptly after it has made a decision to do so. In addition, with very limited exceptions, Units are not transferable, and liquidity will be provided only through repurchase offers made from time to time by the Funds. Units in the Funds are therefore suitable only for investors who can bear the risks associated with the limited liquidity of Units and should be viewed as a long-term investment.
Each Fund expects to distribute cash to the Partners for Units that are repurchased. However, there can be no assurance that each Fund will have sufficient cash to pay for Units that are being repurchased or that each will be able to liquidate investments at favorable prices to pay for repurchased Units. Adviser Funds may be permitted to redeem their interests in-kind. Thus, upon a Fund's withdrawal of all or a portion of its interest in the Master Fund, the Master Fund may liquidate certain holdings in Adviser Funds. The Adviser Funds may pay the Funds' redemption proceeds in securities that are illiquid or difficult to value. In these circumstances, the Investment Manager would seek to dispose of these securities in a manner that is in the best interests of each Fund. The Funds do not intend to make in-kind distributions to the Partners.
In addition, in extreme cases, the Funds may not be able to complete repurchases if the Master Fund is unable to repurchase a portion of the Funds' interests in the Master Fund (held, in the case of the TEI Fund, through the Offshore Fund) due to the Master Fund's holding of illiquid investments.
