To the extent the Master Fund recognizes gain from securities with respect to which there is "acquisition indebtedness" at any time during the twelve-month period ending with the date of their disposition, the percentage of such gain that will be treated as UBTI will be based on the percentage that the highest amount of such "acquisition indebtedness" is of the "average amount of the adjusted basis" of such securities during such period. In determining the unrelated debt-financed income of the Master Fund, an allocable portion of deductions directly connected with the Master Fund's debt-financed property is taken into account. Thus, for instance, a percentage of losses, if any, from debt-financed securities (based on the debt/basis percentage calculation described above) may offset gains treated as UBTI.
Because the calculation of the Master Fund's "unrelated debt-financed income" is complex and will depend in large part on the amount of leverage, if any, used by the Master Fund from time to time,3 it is impossible to predict what percentage of the Core Alternatives Fund's income and gains will be treated as UBTI for a Partner that is an exempt organization. An exempt organization's share of the income or gains of the Core Alternatives Fund that is treated as UBTI cannot be offset by losses of the exempt organization either from the Fund or otherwise, unless those losses are treated as attributable to an unrelated trade or business (e.g., losses from securities for which there is acquisition indebtedness).
To the extent that the Master Fund generates UBTI, the applicable federal tax rate for an exempt organization that is a Partner in the Core Alternatives Fund generally will be either the corporate or the trust tax rate, depending upon the nature of the particular exempt organization.4 However, a charitable remainder trust that has UBTI is subject to a 100% excise tax on the amount of that UBTI under Section 664(c)(2) of the Code. An exempt organization may be required to support, to the satisfaction of the Service, the method used to calculate its UBTI. The Core Alternatives Fund will be required to report to a Partner that is an exempt organization information as to the portion, if any, of its allocated income and gains from the Master Fund for each year which will be treated as UBTI. The calculation of this amount with respect to transactions entered into by the Master Fund may be highly complex, and there is no assurance that the Fund's calculation of UBTI will be accepted by the Service.
In general, if UBTI is allocated to an exempt organization such as a tax-qualified retirement plan or a private foundation, the portion of the Master Fund's income and gains that is not treated as UBTI will continue to be exempt from tax, as will the organization's income and gains from other investments that are not treated as UBTI. Therefore, the possibility of realizing UBTI from its investment in the Fund generally should not affect the tax-exempt status of such an exempt organization.3 However, a title-holding company will not be exempt from tax if it has certain types of UBTI. Moreover, the charitable contribution deduction for a trust under Section 642(c) of the Code may be limited for any year in which the trust has UBTI. A prospective investor that is an exempt organization should consult its tax adviser with respect to the tax consequences of receiving UBTI from the Fund.

Certain Issues Pertaining to Specific Exempt Organizations
Private Foundations. Private foundations and their managers are subject to excise taxes if they invest "any amount in such a manner as to jeopardize the carrying out of any of the foundation's exempt purposes." This rule requires a foundation manager, in making an investment, to exercise "ordinary business care and prudence" under the facts and circumstances prevailing at the time of making the investment, in providing for the short-term and long-term needs of the foundation to carry out its exempt purposes. The factors that a foundation manager may take into account in assessing an investment include the expected rate of return (both income and capital appreciation), the risks of rising and falling price levels, and the need for diversification within the foundation's portfolio.
To avoid the imposition of an excise tax, a private foundation may be required to distribute on an annual basis its "distributable amount," which includes, among other things, the private foundation's "minimum investment return," defined as 5% of the excess of the fair market value of its nonfunctionally related assets (assets not used or held for use in carrying out the foundation's exempt purposes), over certain indebtedness incurred by the foundation in connection with such assets. It appears that a foundation's investment in the Fund will probably be classified as a nonfunctionally related asset. A determination that Units in the Fund are nonfunctionally related assets could conceivably cause cash flow problems for a prospective Partner that is a private foundation. Such an organization could be required to make distributions in an amount determined by reference to unrealized appreciation in the value of its Units in the Fund. Of course, this factor would create less of a problem to the extent that the value of the investment in the Fund is not significant in relation to the value of other assets held by a foundation.
3	The calculation of a particular exempt organization's UBTI will also be affected if it incurs indebtedness to finance its investment in the Fund.
4	An exempt organization is generally required to make estimated tax payments with respect to its UBTI.
5	Certain exempt organizations that realize UBTI in a taxable year will not constitute "qualified organizations" for purposes of Section 514(c)(9)(B)(vi)(I) of the Code, pursuant to which, in limited circumstances, income from certain real estate partnerships in which such organizations invest might be treated as exempt from UBTI. A prospective tax-exempt Limited Partner should consult its tax adviser in this regard.
