Options on Futures
An option on a futures contract or on a physical commodity gives the buyer of the option the right to take a position of a specified amount at a specified price of a specific commodity (the "striking," "strike," or "exercise" price) in the underlying futures contract or commodity.
The buyer of a "call" option acquires the right to take a long position (i.e., the obligation to take delivery of a specified amount at a specified price of a specific commodity) in the underlying futures contract or commodity.
The buyer of a "put" option acquires the right to take a short position (i.e., the obligation to make delivery of a specified amount at a specified price of a specific commodity) in the underlying futures contract or commodity.
The purchase price of an option is referred to as its "premium." The seller (or "writer") of an option is obligated to take a futures position at a specified price opposite to the option buyer if the option is exercised. Thus, the seller of a call option must stand ready to sell (take a short position in the underlying futures contract) at the striking price if the buyer should exercise the option. The seller of a put option, on the other hand, must stand ready to buy (take a long position in the underlying futures contract) at the striking price.
A call option on a futures contract is said to be "in-the-money" if the striking price is below current market levels, and "out-of-the-money" if the striking price is above current market levels. Conversely, a put option on a futures contract is said to be "in-the-money" if the striking price is above current market levels, and " out-of-the-money" if the striking price is below current market levels.
Options have limited life spans, usually tied to the delivery or settlement date of the underlying futures contract. An option that is out-of-the-money and not offset by the time it expires becomes worthless. Options usually trade at a premium above their intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the market price for the underlying futures contract and the striking price) because the option trader is speculating on (or hedging against) future movements in the price of the underlying contract. As an option nears its expiration date, the market and intrinsic value typically move into parity. The difference between an option's intrinsic and market values is referred to as the "time value" of the option. See "Risk Factors — Trading and Performance Risks — Options trading can be more volatile than futures trading" on page 12.
Forward Contracts
Contracts for the future delivery of certain commodities may also be made through banks or dealers pursuant to what are commonly referred to as "forward contracts." A forward contract is a contractual right to purchase or sell a specified quantity of a commodity at or before a specified date in the future at a specified price and, therefore, it is similar to a futures contract. In forward contract trading, a bank or dealer generally acts as principal in the transaction and includes its anticipated profit (the "spread" between the "bid" and the "asked" prices), and in some instances a mark-up, in the prices it quotes for forward contracts. Unlike futures contracts, forward contracts are not standardized contracts; rather, they are the subject of individual negotiation between the parties involved. Because there is no clearinghouse system applicable to forward contracts,
jsft	forward contracts are not fungible, and there is no direct means of "offsetting" a forward contract
rffl	by purchase of an offsetting position on the same exchange as one can a futures contract. In recent
years, the terms of forward contracts have become more standardized and in some instances such contracts now provide a right of offset or cash settlement as an alternative to making delivery on (JtjF	the contract. See "Risk Factors — Trading and Performance Risks — The unregulated nature of
the forward markets creates counterparty risks that do not exist in futures trading on exchanges" on page 14.
