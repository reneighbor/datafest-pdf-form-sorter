MORGAN STANLEY CHARTER SERIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)
by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements. FIN 48 became effective for the Partnerships as of January 1, 2007. The Partnerships have determined that the adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on the Partnerships' financial statements. The Partnerships file U.S. federal and state tax returns. The 2004 through 2007 tax years generally remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and most state tax authorities.
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS No. 157"). SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for the Partnerships as of January 1, 2008. The impact to the Partnerships' financial statements, if any, is currently being assessed.
Trading Equity — The Partnerships' asset "Trading Equity", reflected on the Statements of Financial Condition, consists of (A) cash on deposit with MS&Co. and MSIP to be used as margin for trading; (B) net unrealized gains or losses on futures and forward contracts, which are valued at market and calculated as the difference between original contract value and market value; and for Partnerships which trade in options, (C) options purchased at fair value. Options written at fair value are recorded in Liabilities.
The Partnerships, in their normal course of business, enter into various contracts with MS&Co. and MSIP acting as their commodity brokers. Pursuant to brokerage agreements with MS&Co. and MSIP, to the extent that such trading results in unrealized gains or losses, these amounts are offset and reported on a net basis on the Partnerships' Statements of Financial Condition.
The Partnerships have offset the fair value amounts recognized for forward contracts executed with the same counterparty as allowable under the terms of their master netting agreement with MS&Co. as the counterparty on such contracts. The Partnerships have consistently applied their right to offset.
Brokerage and Related Transaction Fees and Costs — Each Partnership currently pays a flat-rate monthly brokerage fee of Yi2 of 6.00% of the Partnership's Net Assets as of the first day of each month (a 6.00% annual rate). Such fees currently cover all brokerage fees, transaction fees and costs, and ordinary administrative and offering expenses.
Subsequent to September 15, 2006 for Charter Aspect and subsequent to September 30, 2006 for Charter WCM, no brokerage fees were paid until December 1, 2006, given the absence of futures interests trading.
From August 1, 2002 to June 30, 2005, each Partnership paid a flat-rate monthly brokerage fee of V12 of 6.25% of the Partnership's Net Assets as of the first day of each month (a 6.25% annual rate).
Operating Expenses — The Partnerships incur monthly management fees and may incur an incentive fee. All common administrative and continuing offering expenses including legal, auditing, accounting, filing fees, and other related expenses are borne by MS&Co. through the brokerage fees paid by the Partnerships.
Continuing Offering — Units of each Partnership except Charter Campbell are offered at a price equal to 100% of the Net Asset Value per Unit as of the close of business on the last day of each month. Effective September 30, 2006, subscriptions for Units of Charter Aspect and Charter WCM were not accepted until November 30, 2006 month-end closing when Aspect and Winton commenced trading. No selling commissions or charges related to the continuing offering of Units are paid by the limited partners or the Partnerships. MS&Co. pays all such costs.
Effective May 1, 2006, Charter Campbell no longer accepts any subscriptions for Units in the Partnership.
