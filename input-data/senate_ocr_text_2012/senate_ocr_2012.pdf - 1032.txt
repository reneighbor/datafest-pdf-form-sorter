INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGIES
INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
THE FUNDS' INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE. The Master Fund has the same investment objective as the Funds and the Offshore Fund, which is to provide capital appreciation consistent with the return characteristic of the alternative investment portfolios of larger endowments. The Funds' secondary objective is to provide capital appreciation with less volatility than that of the equity markets. To achieve its objective, the Core Alternatives Fund will invest substantially all of its assets in the Master Fund, and the TEI Fund will invest substantially all of its assets in the Offshore Fund, which will invest substantially all of its assets in the Master Fund. The Master Fund invests substantially all of its assets with Advisers selected by the Investment Manager. Generally, the Investment Manager intends to select Advisers that collectively employ widely diversified investment strategies (e.g., allocate to a spectrum of alternative investments).
ALLOCATION. To pursue their objective, the Core Alternatives Fund invests in the Master Fund, and the TEI Fund invests in the Master Fund indirectly through the Offshore Fund. The Master Fund utilizes investment strategies and uses Advisers that are typically available on a collective basis to larger institutions. The Investment Manager primarily pursues the Funds' objective by allocating the Master Fund's assets with Advisers by the Master Fund becoming an investor in an Adviser Fund. However, it may place the Master Fund's assets in an account directly managed by an Adviser ("Adviser Account"). The Investment Manager is responsible for determining the amount of assets to be allocated to each Adviser and for reallocating assets among new and existing Advisers. Generally, the Investment Manager intends to select Advisers that invest in investment strategies within hedge fund strategies and private investment strategies. However, the Investment Manager may also retain Advisers who invest in other investment strategies. These investments may be accomplished in various ways including direct investments and indirect investments such as through derivative transactions including swaps and options. Although it is not required to do so, the Investment Manager anticipates that the Master Fund will typically utilize at least 50 different Advisers. The Investment Manager is responsible for determining the amount of assets to be allocated to each Adviser and for reallocating assets among new and existing Advisers. Advisers may invest in a wide range of instruments and markets, including, but not limited to, U.S. and non-U.S. equities and equity-related instruments (including, without limitation, common and preferred stock, warrants, options, convertible stock and restricted securities), currencies, commodities, real estate, financial futures, fixed income, debt-related instruments (including corporate debt instruments), high yield bank loans, as well as securities and other financial instruments issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or a federal agency or instrumentality, or by a non-U.S. government, agency or instrumentality. Advisers may also invest in repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, securities lending agreements, futures contracts, spot and forward contracts, options, swaps, and hybrid, synthetic and derivative instruments.
In addition to benefiting from the Advisers' individual investment strategies, each Fund expects to achieve the benefits of the Master Fund's broad allocation of its assets among a carefully selected group of Advisers across numerous markets and investment strategies. The Investment Manager expects that by investing through multiple Advisers and across multiple investment strategies, the Master Fund may significantly reduce the volatility inherent in a more concentrated portfolio that is invested in fewer Advisers and/or strategies.
Notwithstanding the above, the Master Fund may, from time to time and subject to applicable law, invest directly in securities of operating companies, including, without limitation, in portfolio companies held by one or more Adviser Funds (whether or not the investment is sourced from an Adviser Fund in which the Master Fund is currently invested).
