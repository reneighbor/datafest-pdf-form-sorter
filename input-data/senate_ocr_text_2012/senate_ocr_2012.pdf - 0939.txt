investment needs. We may also purchase products or services from the consultant and/or their affiliates.
Item 15 - Custody
We are deemed to have "custody" of the assets for the Funds for which our affiliate serves as general partner. In those cases, the Funds will provide audited financial statements to investors on an annual basis in accordance with applicable law.
Item 16 - Investment Discretion
For separate accounts that are managed by us on a discretionary basis, we typically receive authority from you at the outset of the relationship to select the identity and amount of investments to be bought or redeemed. This authority is granted in the investment management agreement. In all cases, however, such discretion is exercised in a manner consistent with the stated investment objectives for the separate account.
When selecting investments, we adhere to the investment policies, limitations and restrictions of each Account as set forth in the investment management agreement or relevant offering document, as applicable. Investment guidelines and restrictions and any amendments thereto must be provided to us in writing.
Item 17 - Voting Client Securities
We, along with certain of our affiliates, have adopted a Proxy Voting Policy (the "Policy"). Note that due to the nature of the investments we make (generally, private equity funds), certain provisions of the Policy will not apply. For purposes of this section, "we" refers to us and our affiliates who participate in the Policy.
We will use our best efforts to vote proxies as part of our authority to manage, acquire and dispose of account assets. We will not vote proxies unless the investment management or investment advisory agreement explicitly authorizes us to vote proxies.
We will vote proxies in a prudent and diligent manner and in your best interests consistent with the objective of maximizing long-term investment returns ("Client Proxy Standard"). In certain situations, you may ask us to vote according to your own proxy voting policy. In those situations, we will comply with your policy.
The Policy addresses a broad range of issues, and provides general voting parameters on proposals that arise most frequently. However, details of specific proposals vary, and those details affect particular voting decisions, as do factors specific to a given company. We endeavor to integrate governance and proxy voting policy with investment goals, using the vote to encourage portfolio companies to enhance long-term shareholder value and to provide a high standard of transparency such that equity markets can value corporate assets appropriately.
