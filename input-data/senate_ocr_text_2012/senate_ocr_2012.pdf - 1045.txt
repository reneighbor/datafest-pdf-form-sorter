both by the Master Fund and other clients of the Investment Manager. To limit its voting interest in certain Adviser Funds, the Master Fund may enter into contractual arrangements under which the Master Fund irrevocably waives its rights (if any) to vote its interests in an Adviser Fund (for example, to facilitate investments in small Adviser Funds determined attractive by the Investment Manager). Other accounts managed by the Investment Manager may also waive their voting rights in a particular Adviser Fund. The Investment Manager will decide whether to waive such voting rights and, in making these decisions, will consider the amounts (if any) invested by the Master Fund and its other clients in the particular Adviser Fund. No rights would be waived or contractually limited for an Adviser Fund that does not provide an ongoing ability for follow-on investment or withdrawal rights, such as an Adviser Fund having a single initial funding, closing or commitment, after which no new investment typically would occur. These voting waiver arrangements may increase the ability of the Master Fund and other clients of the Investment Manager to invest in certain Adviser Funds. However, to the extent the Master Fund contractually forgoes the right to vote the securities of an Adviser Fund, the Master Fund will not be able to vote on matters that require the approval of the interest holders of the Adviser Fund, including matters adverse to the Master Fund's and the Funds' interests.
Although the Master Fund may hold non-voting interests, the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder may nevertheless require the Master Fund to limit its position in any one Adviser Fund in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, as may be determined by the Master Fund in consultation with counsel. These restrictions could change from time to time as applicable laws, rules or interpretations thereof are modified. There are also other statutory tests of affiliation (such as on the basis of control), and, therefore, the prohibitions of the 1940 Act with respect to affiliated transactions could apply in some situations where the Master Fund owns less than 5% of the voting securities of an Adviser Fund. In these circumstances, transactions between the Master Fund and an Adviser Fund may, among other things, potentially be subject to the prohibitions of Section 17 of the 1940 Act notwithstanding that the Master Fund has entered into a voting waiver arrangement.
CONTROL OVER ADVISERS. The Master Fund will invest in Adviser Funds that the Investment Manager believes will generally, and in the aggregate, be managed in a manner consistent with the Funds' investment objective and strategy. The Investment Manager does not and will not control the Advisers and there can be no assurances that an Adviser will manage its Adviser Funds in a manner consistent with the Funds' investment objective.
TEI FUND ONLY
INVESTMENT IN THE OFFSHORE FUND. The Offshore Fund is not registered under the 1940 Act, and is not subject to the investor protections offered thereby. The TEI Fund, as an investor in the Offshore Fund, will not have the protections offered to an investor in registered investment companies. However, the TEI Fund will control the Offshore Fund.
CHANGES IN UNITED STATES AND/OR CAYMAN ISLANDS LAW. If there are changes in the laws of the United States and/or the Cayman Islands, under which the TEI Fund and Offshore Fund, respectively, are organized, so as to result in the inability of the TEI Fund and/or the Offshore Fund to operate as set forth in this Prospectus, there may be substantial effect on the Partners. For example, if Cayman Islands law changes such that the Offshore Fund must conduct business operations within the Cayman Islands, or pay taxes, investors in the TEI Fund would likely suffer decreased investment returns. If Cayman Islands law, which limits the duration of a limited duration company to 30 years, were to change such that, at the end of 30 years, the TEI Fund could not replace the Offshore Fund with another identical limited duration company, the structure of the TEI Fund would be affected, potentially adversely. Such changes could also result in the inability of the TEI Fund to operate on a going-forward basis, resulting in the TEI Fund being liquidated.
REGULATORY CHANGE. The TEI Fund's structure is consistent with a position taken by the staff of the SEC with respect to a non-affiliated investment company allowing a structure whereby the TEI Fund will invest in the Master Fund via the Offshore Fund. To the extent that the views of the SEC staff, which do not represent the views of the SEC itself, were to change, the structure of the TEI Fund's investment in the Master Fund could be adversely affected, possibly affecting the treatment of UBTI.
Subject to obtaining any required regulatory approval, the TEI Fund may determine to invest its assets directly in non-U.S. investment funds that are classified as passive foreign investment companies ("PFICs") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The TEI Fund may pursue such an investment approach only if it believes that it could avoid generating UBTI by making such investments and the approach is approved by the TEI Fund's Board. The TEI Fund will provide Partners with at least 90 days' notice before implementing such a change.
On January 5, 2011, Congressman Doggett introduced in the House of Representatives the "International Tax Competitiveness Act of 2011." If enacted as proposed, the International Tax Competitiveness Act of 2011 will adversely affect the TEI Fund. One provision contained in the bill would treat as a U.S. corporation any foreign corporation the assets of which consist primarily of assets being managed on behalf of investors, if the decisions about how to invest the assets are made in the United States. That would probably cause the Offshore Fund to become subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its worldwide income. If such a
