and for hedge funds generally is evolving, and changes in the direct or indirect regulation of leveraged investors or hedge funds may materially adversely affect the ability of the Funds to pursue its investment objective or strategies. Increased regulatory oversight and other legislation or regulation relating to hedge fund managers, hedge funds and funds of hedge funds could result. Such legislation or regulation could pose additional risks and result in material adverse consequences to the Adviser Funds or the Funds and/or limit potential investment strategies that would have otherwise been used by the Advisers or the Funds in order to seek to obtain higher returns. For example, as discussed in "INVESTOR QUALIFICATIONS" in this Prospectus, the SEC has issued notice that it intends to change the definition of "qualified client."
Certain additional tax risks associated with investments in the Funds are discussed in "TAXES" in this Prospectus and in "Certain Tax Considerations" in the SAI.
SPECIAL RISKS OF FUND OF FUNDS STRUCTURE
NO REGISTRATION. Adviser Funds generally will not be registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act and, therefore, the Master Fund will not be entitled to the various protections afforded by the 1940 Act with respect to its investments in Adviser Funds. Accordingly, the provisions of the 1940 Act, which, among other things, require investment companies to have securities held in custody at all times in segregated accounts and regulate the relationship between the investment company and its asset management, are not applicable to an investment in the Adviser Funds. Unlike registered investment companies such as the Master Fund, Adviser Funds generally are not obligated to disclose the contents of their portfolios. This lack of transparency may make it difficult for the Investment Manager to monitor whether holdings of the Adviser Funds cause the Master Fund to be above specified levels of ownership in certain investment strategies. Although the Master Fund expects to receive information from each Adviser regarding its investment performance on a regular basis, in most cases there is little or no means of independently verifying this information. An Adviser may use proprietary investment strategies that are not fully disclosed to its investbrs and may involve risks under some market conditions that are not anticipated by the Master Fund. In addition, while many Advisers will register with the SEC and state agencies as a result of developments in certain laws, rules and regulations, some Advisers may still be exempt from registration. In such cases, these Advisers will not be subject to various disclosure requirements and rules that would apply to registered investment advisers.
MULTIPLE LEVELS OF FEES AND EXPENSES. Although in many cases investor access to the Adviser Funds may be limited or unavailable, an investor who meets the conditions imposed by an Adviser Fund may be able to invest directly with the Adviser Fund. By investing in Adviser Funds indirectly through the Funds, the Offshore Fund (for the TEI Fund only) and the Master Fund, the investor bears asset-based fees and performance-based fees and allocations. Moreover, investors in each Fund bear a proportionate share of the fees and expenses of that Fund and the Master Fund (including organizational and private placement expenses, operating costs, sales charges, brokerage transaction expenses, and administrative fees) and, indirectly, similar expenses of the Adviser Funds. Investors in the TEI Fund also bear a proportionate share of the fees and expenses of the Offshore Fund (including organizational and private placement expenses, operating costs, sales charges, brokerage transaction expenses, and administrative fees). Thus, investors in the Funds may be subject to higher operating expenses than if he or she invested in an Adviser Fund directly or in a closed-end fund which did not utilize a "fund of funds" structure.
Certain of the Adviser Funds may be subject to a performance-based fee or allocation, irrespective of the performance of other Adviser Funds and the Fund generally. Accordingly, an Adviser to an Adviser Fund with positive performance may receive performance-based compensation from the Adviser Fund, and thus indirectly from the Funds and their Partners, even if a Fund's overall performance is negative. Generally, fees payable to Advisers of the Adviser Funds will range from 1 % to 2% (annualized) of the average NAV of each Fund's investment. In addition, certain Advisers charge an incentive allocation or fee generally ranging from 10% to 35% of an Adviser Fund's net profits, although it is possible that such ranges may be exceeded for certain Advisers. The performance-based compensation received by an Adviser also may create an incentive for that Adviser to make investments that are riskier or more speculative than those that it might have made in the absence of the performance-based allocation. Such compensation may be based on calculations of realized and unrealized gains made by the Adviser without independent oversight.
ADVISERS INVEST INDEPENDENTLY. The Advisers generally invest wholly independently of one another and may at times hold economically offsetting positions. To the extent that the Advisers do, in fact, hold such positions, the Master Fund's portfolio, considered as a whole, may not achieve any gain or loss despite incurring fees and expenses in connection with such positions. Furthermore, it is possible that from time to time various Advisers selected by the Investment Manager may be competing with each other for the same positions in one or more markets. In any such situations, a Fund could indirectly incur certain transaction costs without accomplishing any net investment result.
LIQUIDITY CONSTRAINTS OF ADVISER FUNDS. Since the Master Fund may make additional investments in or affect withdrawals from an Adviser Fund only at certain times pursuant to limitations set forth in the governing documents of the Adviser Fund, a Fund from time to time may have to invest a greater portion of its assets temporarily in money market securities than it
