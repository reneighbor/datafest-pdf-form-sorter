LIMITS OF RISK DISCLOSURES. The above discussions of the various risks, and the related discussion of risks in the SAI, that are associated with the Funds, the Master Fund, the Offshore Fund (with the TEI Fund only), the Units and the Adviser Funds are not, and are not intended to be, a complete enumeration or explanation of the risks involved in an investment in each Fund. Prospective investors should read this entire Prospectus and the applicable Fund's Limited Partnership Agreement and consult with their own advisers before deciding whether to invest in a Fund. In addition, as a Fund's investment program changes or develops over time, an investment in a Fund may be subject to risk factors not currently contemplated or described in this Prospectus.
INVESTOR QUALIFICATIONS
Each prospective investor in a Fund will be required to certify that it is a U.S. person for federal income tax purposes and a "qualified client" within the meaning of Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act. A "qualified client" is, among other categories, (i) a natural person or company (other than an investment company) that represents that it has a net worth (together, in the case of a natural person, with assets held jointly with a spouse) of more than $2,000,000; (ii) a person who has at least $1,000,000 under the Investment Manager's or its affiliates' management, including any amount invested in a Fund; (iii) a person who is a "qualified purchaser" as defined by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder; and (iv) certain knowledgeable employees who participate in the Investment Manager's investment activities. Investors who meet such qualifications are referred to in this Prospectus as "Eligible Investors." The qualifications required to invest in a Fund will appear in an investor application that must be completed by each prospective investor. Existing Partners who wish to request to purchase additional Units will be required to qualify as "Eligible Investors" and to complete an additional investor application prior to the additional purchase.
The SEC has issued notice that it intends to exclude the value of a client's primary residence from the net worth test of Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act. Should a revised definition of "qualified client" under Rule 205-3 take effect, new investors in the Funds will be required to meet such definition. If the rule is enacted as currently proposed, existing Partners may remain invested in the Funds regardless of whether they satisfy the new definition and may purchase additional Units so long as they qualify as and continue to qualify as "Eligible Investors" under the previous definition. The SEC has not issued a final rule on this proposal and, accordingly, the proposed rule is subject to revision.
An investment in the Core Alternatives Fund is not appropriate for certain types of tax-exempt entities, including CRUTs. Tax-exempt entities should consult with their tax advisers prior to making an investment in the Funds.
TENDER OFFERS/OFFERS TO REPURCHASE
In no event will more than 20% of the Units of a Fund be repurchased per quarter. For purposes of clarification, it should be noted that there is no guarantee that a Fund will offer to repurchase 20% (or any other percentage) of the Units of a Fund in any given quarter. Each Fund is structured as a closed-end fund, which means that the Partners will not have the right to redeem their Units on a daily basis. In addition, the Funds do not expect any trading market to develop for the Units. As a result, if investors decide to invest in a Fund, they will have very limited opportunity to sell their Units.
At the discretion of the Board and provided that it is in the best interests of the Funds and their Partners to do so, the Funds intends to provide a limited degree of liquidity to the Partners by conducting repurchase offers generally quarterly with a Valuation Date (as defined below) on or about March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year.
The Board will consider the following factors, among others, in making its determination for each Fund separately to make each repurchase offer:
the recommendation of the Investment Manager and/or the General Partner; whether any Partners have requested to tender Units or portions thereof to the Fund; the liquidity of a Fund's assets (including fees and costs associated with withdrawing from investments); the investment plans and working capital requirements of the Fund; the relative economies of scale with respect to the size of the Fund; the history of a Fund in repurchasing Units or portions thereof; the availability of information as to the value of a Fund's assets;
