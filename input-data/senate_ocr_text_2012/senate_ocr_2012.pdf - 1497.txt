Mr. Craig James Celina, TX 75009
March 2,2012
Dear Mr. James:
This is in response to your request for an extension of time for filing your candidate public financial disclosure report. Your form was originally due on January 18, 2012. However, the Committee previously granted you an extension of your due date to March 2, 2012.
Pursuant to section 101(g) of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, the Committee grants you an additional 45-day extension and your form will, therefore, be due no later than April 16, 2012. Additionally, section 101 (g) provides that the total of all extensions granted to an individual may not exceed 90 days. The total of all extensions granted to you, including this extension, is 89 days.
Please note that section 104(d)(1) of the Act provides that any individual who files a report more than 30 days after the last day of the filing extension period shall pay a filing fee of $200.
Sincerely,
JCS/jal
