and 0.06% of Charter Aspect's net assets or such other agreed amount and is liable for other errors to the extent they result from the trading advisor's willful misconduct or negligence or result from the trading advisor not having acted in good faith and in the reasonable belief that the trading advisor's acts or omissions were in, or not opposed to, the best interests of Charter Aspect. Each partnership has agreed to indemnify and defend its trading advisor and the trading advisor's affiliates against any loss, claim, damage, liability, cost, and expense resulting from a demand, claim, lawsuit, action, or proceeding (other than those incurred as a result of claims brought by or in the right of the indemnified party), relating to the trading activities of the partnership, if a court finds, or independent counsel renders an opinion, that the action or inaction giving rise to the claim did not constitute negligence, willful misconduct or a breach of the management agreement or a representation, warranty or covenant of the trading advisor in that agreement, and was done in good faith and in a manner the indemnified party reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the partnership.
Each partnership will also indemnify its trading advisor and its affiliates against certain losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, those arising under certain federal securities laws, the Commodity Exchange Act, or the securities or Blue Sky law of any jurisdiction, or other laws, including in respect of the offer or sale of units. This indemnification obligation includes, in particular, any actual or alleged misleading or untrue statement of a material fact, or actual or alleged omission of a material fact, made in the registration statement, prospectus, or related selling material, so long as the statement or omission is not a misleading or untrue statement or omission relating to the trading advisor or its principals, was not made in reliance upon, and in conformity with, information or instructions furnished by the trading advisor, or does not result from a breach by the trading advisor of any representation, warranty or agreement relating to the offering. It is the position of the SEC and some state securities regulators that indemnification in connection with violations of the securities laws is against public policy and void.
