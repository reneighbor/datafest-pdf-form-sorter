Capital Account at the time to which the charge relates and (2) no demand will be made after the expiration of three years from the date on which the Person ceased to be a Partner. To the extent that a former Partner fails to pay to the Partnership, in full, any amount required to be charged to the former Partner under Section 5.5(a) of this Agreement, the deficiency will be charged proportionately to the Capital Accounts of the Partners at the time of the act or omission giving rise to the charge to the extent feasible, and otherwise proportionately to the Capital Accounts of the current Partners.
SECTION 5.6 Allocation to Avoid Capital Account Deficits. To the extent that any debits under Sections 5.4 through 5.5 of this Agreement would reduce the balance of the Capital Account of any Limited Partner below zero, that portion of any such debits will be allocated instead to the Capital Account of the General Partner. Any credits in any subsequent Fiscal Period that otherwise would be allocable under Sections 5.4 through 5.5 of this Agreement to the Capital Account of any Limited Partner previously affected by the application of this Section 5.6 will instead be allocated to the Capital Account of the General Partner in amounts necessary to offset all previous debits attributable to the Limited Partner, made in accordance with this Section 5.6, that have not been recovered.
SECTION 5.7 Allocations Prior to Closing Date. Any net cash profits or any net cash losses realized by the Partnership from the purchase or sale of Securities during the period ending on the day prior to the Closing Date will be allocated to the Capital Account of the General Partner. No unrealized item of profit or loss will be allocated under this Section 5.7 to the Capital Account of any Partner.

For each taxable year of the Partnership, items of income, deduction, gain, loss or credit will be allocated for income tax puiposes among the Partners in a manner so as to reflect equitably amounts credited or debited to each Partner's Capital Account for the current and prior taxable years (or relevant portions of those years). Allocations under this Section 5.8 will be made in accordance with the principles of Sections 704(b) and 704(c) of the Code, and in conformity with Treasury Regulations promulgated under these Sections, or the successor provisions to such Sections and Regulations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Partnership will allocate to the Partners those gains or income necessary to satisfy the "qualified income offset" requirement of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-l(b)(2)(ii)(d). If the Partnership realizes net capital gains for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any taxable year during or as of the end of which one or more Positive Basis Partners (as defined in this Section 5.8) withdraw from the Partnership under Article IV or VI of this Agreement, the General Partner may elect to allocate net gains as follows: (a) to allocate net gains among Positive Basis Partners, in proportion to the Positive Basis (as defined in this Section 5.8) of each Positive Basis Partner, until either the full amount of the net.gains has been so allocated or the Positive Basis of each Positive Basis Partner has been eliminated, and (b) to allocate any net gains not so allocated to Positive Basis Partners to the other Partners in a manner that reflects equitably the amounts credited to the Partners' Capital Accounts.
