agreements, each limited partner agrees to reimburse a partnership for any expense or loss (including any trading loss) incurred in connection with the issuance and cancellation of any units issued to the limited partner.
Subscriptions for units are generally irrevocable by subscribers. However, you may revoke your subscription agreement and receive a full refund of the subscription amount and any accrued interest, or revoke the redemption of units in the other commodity pool in the case of an exchange, by delivering written notice to your Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated financial advisor who must forward the notice so that it will be received by the general partner no later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of the applicable monthly closing. There may be other rescission rights under applicable federal and state securities laws. The general partner may reject any subscription, in whole or in part, in its sole discretion.
A sample form of the subscription agreement is annexed to this prospectus as Exhibit B. A separate copy of the subscription agreement accompanies this prospectus or you may obtain one, after delivery of this prospectus, from a local Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated branch office. You will not receive any certificate evidencing units, but you will be sent confirmations of purchases in Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated's customary form.
Once you are an investor in a partnership, you may make additional cash purchases of units of that partnership without executing a new subscription agreement by completing a subscription agreement update form, a sample of which is annexed to this prospectus as Exhibit C, and by contacting your Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated financial advisor and authorizing your financial advisor to deduct the additional amount you want to invest from your Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated customer account. Those amounts will be held in escrow and applied towards the purchase of units in the same manner as initial purchases described above. However, if a new prospectus has been issued since the date of your original subscription agreement you will be required to complete a new subscription update form. Further, your Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated financial advisor will be required to confirm to the general partner that the information you provided, and the representations and warranties you made, in your original subscription agreement, including, in particular, that you satisfy applicable minimum financial suitability requirements, are still true and correct. You may not use the subscription procedure described in this paragraph to purchase additional units in a partnership by way of an exchange or to purchase units of a partnership in which you are not currently an investor; in either of those cases, you must execute a new subscription agreement.
