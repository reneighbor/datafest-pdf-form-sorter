Redemption Dates (a Special Redemption Date may take place on a regular Redemption Date); and (ii) following the close of business on the date of the 50% decrease giving rise to such notice, the Partnership shall liquidate all existing positions as promptly as reasonably practicable and shall suspend all Futures Interests trading through the Special Redemption Date. Thereafter, the General Partner shall determine whether to reinstitute Futures Interests trading or to terminate the Partnership. As used herein, "material change in the Partnership's trading policies" shall mean any material change in those trading policies specified in Section 8(c).
The Net Asset Value of a Unit shall be determined daily by the General Partner, and the most recent Net Asset Value calculation shall be promptly supplied by the General Partner in writing to any Limited Partner after the General Partner shall have received a written request from such Partner.
In addition, no increase (subject to the limits in the fourth paragraph of Section 7(e)) in any of the management, incentive, or brokerage fees payable by the Partnership, or any caps (other than those described in the fourth paragraph of Section 7(e)) on management fees, incentive fees, brokerage commissions or fees, Transaction Fees and Costs, ordinary administrative expenses, or net excess interest or compensating balance benefits, all as described in the Prospectus, may take effect until the first business day following a Redemption Date, provided that: (i) notice of such increase is mailed to each Limited Partner at least five business days prior to the last date on which a Request for Redemption must be received by the General Partner with respect to the applicable Redemption Date; (ii) such notice shall describe the redemption and voting rights of Limited Partners, as set forth in Sections 10(b) and 15; and (iii) Limited Partners redeeming Units at the first Redemption Date following such notice shall not be subject to the redemption charges described in Section 10(b).
In addition, following each Closing, the General Partner shall send written notice to any Limited Partner which has acquired of record more than five percent of the outstanding Units of the Partnership, so that such Limited Partner may comply with the reporting requirements of Section 13(d) and (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Regulation 13D-G promulgated thereunder.
10. Transfer; Redemption of Units; Exchange Privilege.
(a) Transfer. A Limited Partner may transfer or assign his Units only as provided in this Section 10(a). No transferee or assignee shall become a substituted Limited Partner unless the General Partner first consents to such transfer or assignment in writing, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. Any transfer or assignment of Units which is permitted hereunder shall be effective as of the end of the month in which such transfer or assignment is made; provided, however, that the Partnership need not recognize any transfer or assignment until it has received at least 30 days' prior written notice thereof from the Limited Partner, which notice shall set forth the address and social security or taxpayer identification number of the transferee or assignee and the number of Units to be transferred or assigned, and which notice shall be signed by the Limited Partner. No transfer or assignment of Units will be effective or recognized by the Partnership if the transferee or assignee, or the transferor or assignor (if fewer than all Units held by the transferor or assignor are being transferred or assigned), would, by reason of such transfer or assignment, acquire Units which do not meet the minimum initial subscription requirements, as described in the Prospectus; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to transfers or assignments of Units (i) by the way of gift or inheritance, (ii) to any members of the Limited Partner's family, (iii) resulting from divorce, annulment, separation or similar proceedings, or (iv) to any person who would be deemed an Affiliate of the Limited Partner (for purposes of this clause (iv), the term "Affiliate" also includes any partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity for which such Limited Partner acts as an officer, director or partner). No transfer or assignment shall be permitted unless the General Partner is satisfied that (i) such transfer or assignment would not be in violation of the Act or applicable federal, state, or non-U.S. securities laws, and (ii) notwithstanding such transfer or assignment, the Partnership shall continue to be classified as a partnership rather than as an association taxable as a corporation under the Code. No transfer or assignment of Units shall be effective or recognized by the Partnership if such transfer or assignment would result in the termination of the Partnership for federal income tax purposes, and any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be ineffective to transfer or assign any such Units. Any transferee or assignee of Units who has not been admitted to the Partnership as a substituted Limited Partner shall not have any of the rights of a Limited Partner, except that such person shall receive that share of capital and profits, shall have that
