Description of the Diversified Trading Program
Winton will trade assets in accordance with its Diversified Trading Program which has been trading since 1997. The Winton Diversified Trading Program uses a statistically-derived systematic model to trade a diversified portfolio of more than 100 futures, options and forward contracts and, for accounts other than Charter WCM, certain over-the-counter products such as swaps. The contracts traded cover a global range and are widely diversified across the financial and commodity sectors. Winton expects the margin requirements for Charter WCM's assets traded pursuant to Winton's Diversified Trading Program to average about 20% of those assets.
As of February 29, 2008, Winton Capital Management Limited was managing approximately $11.0 billion pursuant to its Diversified Trading Program and approximately $11.5 billion of client assets in all of its programs (notional funds excluded).
