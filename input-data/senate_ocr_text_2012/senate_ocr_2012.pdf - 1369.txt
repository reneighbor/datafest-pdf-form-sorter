MORGAN STANLEY CHARTER SERIES
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)
Redemptions — Limited partners may redeem some or all of their Units at 100% of the Net Asset Value per Unit as of the end of the last day of any month that is at least six months after the closing at which a person first becomes a limited partner. The Request for Redemption must be delivered to a limited partner's local Morgan Stanley Branch Office in time for it to be forwarded and received by Demeter no later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of the month in which the redemption is to be effective. Redemptions must be made in whole Units, with a minimum of 100 Units required for each redemption, unless a limited partner is redeeming his entire interest in a particular Partnership.
Units redeemed on or prior to the last day of the twelfth month from the date of purchase will be subject to a redemption charge equal to 2% of the Net Asset Value of a Unit on the Redemption Date. Units redeemed after the last day of the twelfth month and on or prior to the last day of the twenty-fourth month from the date of purchase will be subject to a redemption charge equal to 1% of the Net Asset Value of a Unit on the Redemption Date. Units redeemed after the last day of the twenty-fourth month from the date of purchase will not be subject to a redemption charge. The foregoing redemption charges are paid to MS&Co.
Exchanges — On the last day of the first month which occurs more than six months after a person first becomes a limited partner in each Partnership except Charter Campbell, and at the end of each month thereafter, limited partners may exchange their Units among Charter Aspect, Charter Graham, and Charter WCM (subject to certain restrictions outlined in the Limited Partnership Agreements) without paying additional charges.
Effective September 30, 2006, Charter Aspect and Charter WCM did not accept any exchanges of Units from any other Charter Series of Funds until the November 30, 2006 month-end closing when Aspect and Winton commenced trading.
Effective May 1, 2006, Charter Campbell no longer accepts any exchanges of Units from any other Charter Series of fund for Units of Charter Campbell.
Distributions — Distributions, other than redemptions of Units, are made on a pro-rata basis at the sole discretion of Demeter. No distributions have been made to date. Demeter does not intend to make any distributions of the Partnerships' profits.
Income Taxes — No provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying financial statements, as partners are individually responsible for reporting income or loss based upon their respective share of each Partnership's revenues and expenses for income tax purposes.
Dissolution of the Partnerships — Charter Aspect will terminate on December 31, 2025 and Charter Campbell, Charter Graham, and Charter WCM will terminate on December 31, 2035 or at an earlier date if certain conditions occur as defined in each Partnership's Limited Partnership Agreement.
Litigation Settlement — Charter Aspect received notification of a preliminary entitlement to payment from the Sumitomo Copper Litigation Settlement Administrator, and Charter Aspect received a settlement award payment in the amount of $3,661 during November 2005. Any amounts received are accounted for in the period received, for the benefit of the limited partners at the date of receipt.
