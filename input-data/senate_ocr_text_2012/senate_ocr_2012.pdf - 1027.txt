repurchase of interests in the Master Fund effective as of that date, and will decrease the net profits or increase the net losses of the Master Fund that are credited to its interest holders, including each Fund. Although neither the Funds nor the Offshore Fund will pay any direct investment management fee, the Funds and the Offshore Fund will bear, as a result of their investment in the Master Fund, their allocable portion of the management fee charged to the Master Fund.
Performance Allocation
The General Partner of the Master Fund is allocated a performance allocation (calculated and accrued monthly and payable annually and calculated separately for the Core Alternatives Fund, the TEI Fund and each other fund that serves as a feeder fund to the Master Fund) equal to 10% of the amount by which net new profits of the limited partner interests of the Master Fund exceed the non-cumulative "hurdle amount," which is calculated as of the last day of the preceding calendar year of the Master Fund at a rate equal to the yield-to-maturity of the 90 day U.S. Treasury Bill as reported by the Wall Street Journal for the last business day of the preceding calendar year (the "Performance Allocation"). The Performance Allocation is made on a "peak to peak," or "high watermark" basis, which means that the Performance Allocation is made only with respect to new net profits. If, with respect to a Fund, the Master Fund has a net loss in any period followed by a net profit, no Performance Allocation will be made with respect to such subsequent appreciation until such net loss has been recovered.
Fees of Advisers
Advisers will charge the Master Fund asset-based fees, and certain Advisers will also be entitled to receive performance-based fees or allocations. Such fees and performance-based compensation are in addition to both the fees that are charged by the Investment Manager to the Master Fund and allocated to the Funds, and the Performance Allocation charged by the General Partner. Moreover, an investor in the Core Alternatives Fund bears a proportionate share of the expenses of the Master Fund and the Core Alternatives Fund and, indirectly, similar expenses of the Adviser Funds. Likewise, an investor in the TEI Fund bears a proportionate share of the expenses of the Master Fund, the Offshore Fund and the TEI Fund, and indirectly, similar expenses of the Adviser Funds.
Investor Qualifications
Each prospective investor in a Fund will be required to certify that it is a "qualified client" within the meaning of Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act. A "qualified client" means an individual or company (other than an investment company) that has a net worth (or in the case of individuals, a joint net worth with their spouse) of more than $2,000,000, or that meets certain other qualification requirements. The SEC has issued notice that it intends to change the definition of "qualified client" by, among other things, excluding the value of an investor's primary residence from the net worth test under Rule 205-3. For more information see "INVESTOR QUALIFICATIONS." In addition, Units are generally being offered only to investors that are U.S. persons for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Investors who meet such qualifications are referred to in this Prospectus as "Eligible Investors."
The Offering
The minimum initial investment in a Fund by any investor is $50,000, and the minimum additional investment in either Fund by a Partner is $5,000. However, the General Partner of each Fund, in its sole discretion, may accept investments below these minimums.

Units will generally be offered for purchase as of the first day of each calendar month, except that Units may be offered more or less frequently as determined by the Board in its sole discretion. Potential investors should deposit monies in the capital account by wire transfer pursuant to instructions provided to them by the Funds.
Subscriptions are generally subject to the receipt of cleared funds on or prior to the acceptance date set by the Funds and notified to prospective investors. Pending the closing of any offering, funds received from prospective investors will be placed in an interest-bearing escrow account with UMB Bank, N.A., the Funds' escrow agent. On the date of any closing, the balance in the escrow account with respect to each investor whose investment is accepted will be invested in the applicable Fund on behalf of such investor. Any interest earned on escrowed amounts will be credited to such Fund.
