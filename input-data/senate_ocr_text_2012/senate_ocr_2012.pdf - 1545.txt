Ms. Nancy Erickson Secretary of the Senate United States Capitol Building, S-312 Washington, D.C. 20510
Dear Ms. Erickson:
\
1 learned today that my uncompensated affiliation with the Board of Advisors of the University of Louisville's McConnell Center for Political Leadership has been inadvertently omitted from Part VIII of my annual United States Senate Public Financial Disclosure Reports. As such, this correspondence should serve to amend each of my Public Financial Disclosure Reports for calendar years 1992 through 2010. I direct that the operative disclosure reports be amended to reflect this administrative error and that the instant correspondence be made available via the Senate Office of Public Records as soon as practicable.
