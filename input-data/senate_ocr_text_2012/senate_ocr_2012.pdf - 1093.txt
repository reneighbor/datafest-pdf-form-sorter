(f)	A Limited Partner tendering only some of its Units for repurchase will be required to maintain a minimum capital account balance of $100,000. The Partnership may reduce the number of Units to be purchased from a Limited Partner to maintain the required minimum balance. Such minimum balance requirement may be waived by the General Partner in its sole discretion, subject to applicable federal securities laws. Additionally, the General Partner may, in its discretion, cause the Partnership to repurchase all of a Limited Partner's entire Units if the Limited Partner's Capital Account balance in the Partnership, as a result of repurchase or Transfer requests by the Limited Partner, is less than $100,000 or such other minimum amount established by the General Partner from time to time in its sole discretion.
(g)	Except as provided in Section 4.5(h) of this Agreement, a General Partner may tender its Units under Section 4.5(a) of this Agreement only if and to the extent that (1) the repurchase would not cause the value of the Capital Account of the General Partner to be less than the value required to be maintained under Section 5.1(b) of this Agreement and (2) in the view of legal counsel to the Partnership, the repurchase would not jeopardize the classification of the Partnership as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
(h)	If a General Partner ceases to serve in that capacity under Section 4.1 of this Agreement (other than pursuant to Section 4.1(i)) and the business of the Partnership is continued in accordance with Section 6.1(a)(2)(B) of this Agreement, the former General Partner (or its trustee or other legal representative) may, by written notice to the Directors within 60 days of the action resulting in the continuation of the Partnership under Section 6.1(a)(2)(B), tender to the Partnership all or any portion of its Units. Within 30 days after the receipt of notice, the Directors will cause the Units to be repurchased by the Partnership for cash in an amount equal to the balance of the former General Partner's Capital Account or applicable portion of the Capital Account. If the former General Partner does not tender to the Partnership all of its Units as permitted by this Section 4.5(h), the Units will automatically convert to and will be treated in all respects as the Units of a Limited Partner. If the General Partner ceases to serve in this capacity under Section 4.1 of this Agreement (other than pursuant to Section 4.1(i)) and the Partnership is not continued under Section 6.1(a)(2)(B) of this Agreement, the liquidation and distribution provisions of Article VI of this Agreement will apply to the General Partner's Units.
(i)	The General Partner may cause the Partnership to repurchase Units of a Limited Partner or any Person acquiring Units from or through a Limited Partner, on terms fair to the Partnership and to the Limited Partner or Person acquiring Units from or through such Limited Partner, in the event that the General Partner, in its sole discretion, determines or has reason to believe that:
(1) the Units have been Transferred in violation of Section 4.4 of this Agreement, or the Units have vested in any Person other than by operation of law as the result of the death, dissolution, bankruptcy, insolvency or adjudicated incompetence of the Limited Partner;
