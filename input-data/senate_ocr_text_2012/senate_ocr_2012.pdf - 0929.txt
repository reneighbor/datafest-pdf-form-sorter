fund. When the Volcker Rule becomes effective, which will be no later than July 21, 2012, it will limit the aggregate equity interests, partnership interests and other ownership interests of Morgan Stanley in hedge funds and private equity funds to a maximum of 3% of Morgan Stanley's Tier 1 capital. In addition, Morgan Stanley will be able to own no more than 3% of the total ownership interests of any private equity fund or hedge fund that Morgan Stanley organizes and offers. Banking entities such as Morgan Stanley also will not be permitted, directly or indirectly, to guarantee, assume or otherwise insure the obligations or performance of such funds, or any funds in which such funds invest. Upon effectiveness, the Volcker Rule will also prohibit Morgan Stanley from engaging in certain "covered transactions" with the Fund, such as extensions of credit. The Volcker Rule may require Morgan Stanley and its affiliates (including us) to restructure or terminate our affiliations with certain of our Funds. During a statutory transition period for Morgan Stanley to comply with the requirements of the Volcker Rule, the Funds may need to change their names so as to avoid sharing a name with Morgan Stanley, and our affiliates may need to reduce its investment in a Fund so as to comply with the 3% limitation on Morgan Stanley's investment of Tier 1 capital, and take other actions. Because the Volcker Rule would constitute a recent legislative change, the full scope of its impact is not yet known. There may be other direct or indirect consequences of the Volcker Rule and the Dodd-Frank legislation that affect Morgan Stanley, its affiliates or the General Partner and that may result in a material adverse effect on the Funds.

Restricted and Illiquid Investments. Although we anticipate that most Investment Funds will invest primarily in publicly traded securities, they may invest a portion of the value of their total assets in restricted securities and other investments that are illiquid. Restricted securities are securities that may not be sold to the public without an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or that may be sold only in a privately negotiated transaction or pursuant to an exemption from registration.
When registration is required to sell a security, an Investment Fund may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses, and a considerable period may elapse between the decision to sell and the time the Investment Fund may be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration statement. If adverse market conditions developed during this period, an Investment Fund might obtain a less favorable price than the price that prevailed when the Investment Fund decided to sell. Investment Funds may be unable to sell restricted and other illiquid securities at the most opportune times or at prices approximating the value at which they purchased the securities.
A Fund's interests in Investment Funds are themselves illiquid and subject to substantial restrictions on transfer. A Fund's ability to liquidate an interest in an Investment Fund will likely be limited. A Fund is subject to certain Investment Funds' initial lock-up periods beginning at the time of a Fund's initial investment in an Investment Fund, during which a Fund may not withdraw its investment. In addition, certain Investment Funds may at times elect to suspend completely or limit withdrawal rights for an
