QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Introduction
Each partnership is a commodity pool engaged primarily in the speculative trading of futures, forwards, and options. The market-sensitive instruments held by each partnership are acquired for speculative trading purposes only and, as a result, all or substantially all of each partnership's assets are at risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market-sensitive instruments is inherent to the primary business activities of each partnership.
The futures, forwards, and options traded by each partnership involve varying degrees of related market risk. Market risk is often dependent upon changes in the level or volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, and prices of financial instruments and commodities, factors that result in frequent changes in the fair value of each partnership's open positions, and consequently in its earnings, whether realized or unrealized, and cash flow. Gains and losses on open positions of exchange-traded futures, exchange-traded forward, and exchange-traded futures-styled options contracts are settled daily through variation margin. Gains and losses on off-exchange-traded forward currency contracts are settled upon termination of the contract. However, each partnership is required to meet margin requirements equal to the net unrealized loss on open forward currency contracts in each partnership's accounts with the counterparty, which is accomplished by daily maintenance of the cash balance in a customer account held at Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated.
Each partnership's total market risk may increase or decrease as it is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the diversification among each partnership's open positions, the volatility present within the markets, and the liquidity of the markets.
The face value of the market sector instruments held by each partnership is typically many times the applicable margin requirements. Margin requirements generally range between 2% and 15% of contract face value. Additionally, the use of leverage causes the face value of the market sector instruments held by each partnership typically to be many times the total capitalization of each partnership.
Each partnership's past performance is no guarantee of future results. Any attempt to numerically quantify a partnership's market risk is limited by the uncertainty of its speculative trading. Each partnership's speculative trading and use of leverage may cause future losses and volatility (i.e. "risk of ruin") that far exceed each partnership's experiences to date under "Each Partnership's Value at Risk in Different Market Sectors" section below and significantly exceed the VaR tables disclosed below.
Limited partners will not be liable for losses exceeding the current net asset value of their investment.
Quantifying each Partnership's Trading Value at Risk
The following quantitative disclosures regarding the market risk exposure of each partnership contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 2lEofthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934). All quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward-looking statements for purposes of safe harbor, except for statements of historical fact
Each partnership accounts for open positions on the basis of mark to market accounting principles. Any loss in the market value of a partnership's open positions is directly reflected in the partnership's earnings and cash flow.
