Professional Management
Professional money management is one of the most significant benefits a managed futures investment can offer. A professional trading advisor has several advantages over an individual investor.
•	Capitalization — Trading advisors are well capitalized, and capable of managing market volatility.
•	Discipline — Trading advisors employ established, disciplined approaches to futures trading, as well as strict money management policies and techniques.
•	Planned Strategy — Trading advisors research and design trading strategies that seek to provide long-term profit potential.
•	Risk Control — Trading advisors offer a full time commitment to risk control, based upon calculated risk management strategies and years of research and experience.
•	Research and Development — Trading advisors are committed to ongoing research and development, in an effort to continuously improve upon existing systems and technology in order to keep pace with industry developments and potentially capitalize on market opportunities as they occur.
In considering the advantages of utilizing a professional trading advisor, you also should consider the fees a trading advisor will be paid to manage a partnership's account. The monthly management fee for each partnership is 1/12 of 2.0% of the partnership's average month-end net assets and the monthly incentive fee is 20.0% of trading profits.
The Trading Advisor Selection Process
The trading advisor for each partnership was chosen by the general partner based upon a strict selection process, including such criteria as performance history, experience, personnel, and due diligence. The performance history and trading experience of the trading advisors chosen for each partnership span a range of 9 to 12 years, and each trading advisor employs experienced personnel. Additionally, the general partner monitors daily each trading advisor's activities on behalf of a partnership and periodically conducts on-site due diligence visits to remain abreast of each trading advisor's continuing efforts toward research and development. This selection process is described below.
In order for a trading advisor to be selected by the general partner, a qualitative and quantitative due diligence process is undertaken, considering the factors described below. The general partner's primary objective in the selection process is to allocate assets to trading advisors with well-established performance histories and whom it believes have the potential to continue to be successful in the future.
Monitoring is an important second phase in the due diligence process. The general partner has invested significant resources into its proprietary Fund Management System, a comprehensive computerized management system. This sophisticated system produces daily control reports generated from actual trading data and enables the general partner to closely monitor the activity and performance of trading advisors relative to their historical profile.
Monitoring also occurs on a periodic basis by discussing with the trading advisors their performance relative to profile and peer trading advisors, recent market conditions, and trading opportunities. Ongoing research and development, and continued on-site due diligence visits are conducted. While the due diligence process cannot guarantee future success, the general partner believes the process can provide the basis for sound decision-making and can increase the potential for future success.
