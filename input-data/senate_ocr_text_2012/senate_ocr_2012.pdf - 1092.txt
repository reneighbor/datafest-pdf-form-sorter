(8)	the anticipated tax consequences to the Partnership of any proposed repurchases of Units; and
(9)	the recommendations of the General Partner.
The Directors will cause the Partnership to repurchase Units in accordance with written tenders only on terms fair to the Partnership and to all Partners and Persons holding Units acquired from Partners.
(b)	Upon the commencement of an offer to repurchase Units, the Partnership will send an advance notification of the offer (the "Notice") to the Partners via their financial intermediaries. The Notice will specify, among other things:
(1)	the number of Units that the Partnership is offering to repurchase;
(2)	the date on which a Partner's repurchase request is due;
(3)	the Valuation Date (as defined in Section 4.5(d) below) applicable to the repurchase offer;
(4)	the date the proceeds from their Unit sales shall be due to the Partners; and
(5)	the NAV per Unit as of the date of the Notice.
(c)	In no event will more than 20% of the Units of the Partnership be repurchased per quarter. A Partner who has been a Partner for less than 12 consecutive months prior to the Valuation Date of such repurchase offer, may participate in such offer subject to a penalty of up to 5% of the amount requested to be repurchased (to be netted against withdrawal proceeds). The minimum value of a repurchase is $50,000, subject to the discretion of the General Partner to allow otherwise. A Partner whose Units are repurchased by the Partnership will not be entitled to a return of any placement fee that was charged in connection with the Partner's purchase of the Units.
(d)	Units are expected to be repurchased at their net asset value determined as of approximately June 30, September 30, December 31 and March 31, as applicable (each such date, a "Valuation Date"). Partners tendering Units for repurchase shall provide written notice of their intent to so tender by the date specified in the Notice, which date shall be approximately 65 days prior to the date of repurchase by the Partnership. Partners tendering their Units may not have all such Units accepted for repurchase by the Partnership. The Partnership may elect to repurchase less than the full amount a Partner requests to be repurchased. If a repurchase offer is oversubscribed, the Partnership may repurchase only a pro rata portion of the amount tendered by each Partner,
(e)	The Directors may under certain circumstances elect to postpone, suspend or terminate an offer to repurchase Units.
