funds which may be contributed to a partnership. The general partner may in the future subdivide or combine outstanding units of any partnership, in its discretion, provided that any subdivision or combination will not affect the net asset value of any limited partner's interest in the partnership.
Each partnership has agreed to indemnify its trading advisors, the general partner and any additional sellers in connection with the offer and sale of units. See "Fiduciary Responsibility and Liability" beginning on page 21.
Continuing Offering
Units of each continuously-offered partnership are being offered for sale at monthly closings held on the last day of each month. Units will be offered and sold at the net asset value of a unit of the partnership on the date of the monthly closing. Since you must subscribe for units prior to the month-end closing date, you will not know the actual per unit purchase price until after the monthly closing has occurred. The sale amount will be delivered to the partnership that sold the unit.
Escrow Arrangements
During the continuing offering, if your subscription is not immediately rejected by the general partner, your subscription funds will be transferred to, and held in escrow by, The Bank of New York, New York, New York. The subscription funds held in escrow will be invested in the escrow agent's interest-bearing money market account, and will earn the interest rate then paid by the bank on that account. If the general partner accepts your subscription, at the applicable month-end closing the escrow agent will pay your subscription funds to the appropriate partnership and pay any interest earned on those funds to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated. Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated in turn will credit your Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated customer account with the interest. If the general partner rejects your subscription, the escrow agent will promptly pay the rejected subscription funds and any interest earned to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, and Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated will then credit your Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated customer account with those amounts, and the funds will be immediately available for investment or withdrawal. If you closed your Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated customer account, any subscription returned and interest earned will be paid by check. Interest will be earned on subscription funds from the day of deposit with the escrow agent to the day that funds are either paid to the appropriate partnerships in the case of accepted subscriptions or paid to Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated in the case of rejected subscriptions. At all times during the continuing offering, and prior to each monthly closing, subscription funds will be in the possession of the escrow agent, and at no time will the general partner hold or take possession of the funds.
