Market Risk
Each partnership is a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. Each partnership trades futures contracts, options on futures contracts, and forward contracts on physical commodities and other commodity interests, including, but not limited to, foreign currencies, financial instruments, metals, energy, and agricultural products. In entering into these contracts, each partnership is subject to the market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts' being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the positions held by a partnership at the same time, and its trading advisor was unable to offset positions of the partnership, the partnership could lose all of its assets and the limited partners would realize a 100% loss.
In addition to the trading advisors' internal controls, each trading advisor must comply with the partnership's trading policies that include standards for liquidity and leverage that must be maintained. The trading advisor and the general partner monitor each partnership's trading activities to ensure compliance with the trading policies and the general partner can require a partnership's trading advisor to modify positions of the partnership if the general partner believes they violate the partnership's trading policies.
Credit Risk
In addition to market risk, in entering into futures, forward, and options contracts, there is a credit risk to each partnership that the counterparty on a contract will not be able to meet its obligations to the partnership. The ultimate counterparty or guarantor of a partnership for futures, forward, and options contracts traded in the United States and most non-U.S. exchanges on which the partnership trades is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, a clearinghouse is backed by the membership of the exchange and will act in the event of non-performance by one of its members or one of its member's customers, which should significantly reduce this credit risk. There is no assurance that a clearinghouse, exchange, or other exchange member will meet its obligations to the partnership, and the general partner and the commodity brokers will not indemnify the partnership against a default by such parties. Further, the law is unclear as to whether a commodity broker has any obligation to protect its customers from loss in the event of an exchange or clearinghouse defaulting on trades effected for the broker's customers. In cases where a partnership trades off-exchange forward contracts with a counterparty, the sole recourse of the partnership will be the forward contract's counterparty. For a list of the non-U.S. exchanges on which the partnerships trade, see "Use of Proceeds" beginning on page 27. For an additional discussion of the credit risks relating to trading on non-U.S. exchanges, see "Risk Factors—Trading and Performance Risks—Trading on non-U.S. exchanges presents greater risks to each partnership them trading on US. exchanges" on page 13.
The general partner deals with these credit risks of the partnerships in several ways. First, the general partner monitors each.partnership's credit exposure to each exchange on a daily basis. The commodity brokers inform each partnership, as with all of their customers, of each partnership's net margin requirements for all of each partnership's existing open positions, and the general partner has installed a system which permits it to monitor each partnership's potential net credit exposure, exchange by exchange, by adding the unrealized trading gains on each exchange, if any, to the partnership's margin liability thereon.
Second, each partnership's trading policies limit the amount of the partnership's net assets that can be committed at any given time to futures contracts and require a minimum amount of diversification in the partnership's trading, usually over several different products and exchanges. Historically, each partnership's exposure to any one exchange has typically amounted to only a small percentage of its total net assets and on those relatively few occasions where a partnership's credit exposure climbs above such level, the general partner deals with the situation on a case by
