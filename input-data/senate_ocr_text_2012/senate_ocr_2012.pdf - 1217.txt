2007 Results. The most significant trading gains of approximately 5.0% were recorded in the energy markets, primarily during July, September, October, and December, from long futures positions in crude oil and its related products as prices trended higher due to persistent concerns that instability in Iraq and tension regarding Iran's nuclear program might negatively affect global supply. In addition, energy prices increased due to continued weakness in the value of the U.S. dollar as U.S. dollar-denominated assets became more attractive to investors, Within the global interest rate markets, gains of approximately 2.7% were experienced primarily during January, March, April, May, and June from short positions in Australian, European, and U.S. interest rate futures as prices trended lower amid solid economic data, rising equity prices, and surging home prices in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, which reduced demand for the "safe haven" of fixed-income investments. As such, prices were also pulled lower on investor belief that these respective central banks might need to raise interest rates to curb inflation. Further gains were recorded during November from newly established long positions in British and U.S. fixed-income futures as prices increased following a sharp decline in global equity markets and forecasts of deeper losses related to sub-prime investments, which fueled speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of England might need to reduce borrowing costs in response to widespread fears of an economic decline.

Meanwhile, the value of the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, and New Zealand dollar, also known as the "commodity currencies", moved higher in the wake of consistently rising commodity prices. During October, the value of the U.S. dollar continued to decline against the aforementioned currencies amid investors sentiment that the U.S. Federal Reserve might need to continue reducing interest rates in order to prevent the U.S. economy from slowing. Smaller gains of approximately 1.9% were recorded in the agricultural complex, primarily during September, November, and December, from
