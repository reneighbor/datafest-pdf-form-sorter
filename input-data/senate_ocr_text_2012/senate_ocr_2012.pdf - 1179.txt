Tax Considerations
The following tax aspects of owning units are based upon the opinion of legal counsel, Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP:
•	Even though the general partner currently does not intend to make distributions, your allocable share of the trading profits and other income of the partnerships in which you invest will be taxable to you.
•	The trading activities of each partnership, in general, generate capital gains and losses and ordinary income. 40% of any trading profits on U.S. exchange-traded contracts and certain forward contracts on foreign currency are taxed as short-term capital gains at your ordinary income tax rate, while 60% of such gains are taxed at your long-term capital gains tax rate. We expect that each partnership's trading gains from other contracts will be primarily short-term capital gains. This tax treatment applies regardless of how long you hold your units.
•	You may deduct losses on units against capital gains income. You may deduct losses in excess of capital gains against ordinary income only to the extent of $3,000 per year. You may also have to pay tax on a partnership's interest income even though you have lost money on your units.
