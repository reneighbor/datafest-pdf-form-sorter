CREDIT FACILITY. The Funds and the Master Fund may enter into one or more credit agreements or other similar agreements negotiated on market terms (each, a "Borrowing Transaction") with one or more banks or other financial institutions which may or may not be affiliated with the Investment Manager (each, a "Financial Institution") as chosen by the Investment Manager and approved by the Boards of each Fund and the Master Fund, as applicable. To facilitate such Borrowing Transactions, the Funds and the Master Fund may pledge their assets to the Financial Institution. Currently, the Master Fund has established a secured line of credit with Credit Suisse International ("Credit Suisse") and has agreed to pledge certain assets, to be held in custody by U.S. Bank, as collateral against any drawdown it makes on the line of credit.
Any Borrowing Transaction, including the current agreement with Credit Suisse, will primarily be used to provide the Funds or the Master Fund, as applicable, with liquidity for investments. Borrowing Transactions may be used for additional purposes, including to pay fees and expenses, to make annual income distributions and to satisfy certain repurchase offers in a timely manner to ensure liquidity for the investors.
ABSENCE OF LIABILITY. Subject to any limitations imposed by the federal securities laws, neither the General Partner nor the Investment Manager shall be liable to a Fund or any of the Partners for any loss or damage occasioned by any act or omission in the performance of their respective services as such in the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of their duties.
ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING. If a Fund, the Investment Manager or any governmental agency believes that a Fund has sold Units to, or is otherwise holding assets of, any person or entity that is acting, directly or indirectly, in violation of U.S., international or other anti-money laundering laws, rules, regulations, treaties or other restrictions, or on behalf of any suspected terrorist or terrorist organization, suspected drug trafficker, or senior foreign political figure(s) suspected of engaging in corruption, a Fund, Investment Manager or such governmental agency may freeze the assets of such person or entity invested in the Fund or suspend the repurchase of Units. A Fund may also be required to, or deem it necessary or advisable to, remit or transfer those assets to a governmental agency, in some cases without prior notice to the investor.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. The Investment Manager and its affiliates, as well as many of the Advisers and their respective affiliates, provide investment advisory and other services to clients other than the Funds, the Offshore Fund, the Master Fund, Adviser Funds and Adviser Accounts. In addition, investment professionals associated with the Investment Manager or Advisers may carry on investment activities for their own accounts and the accounts of family members (collectively with other accounts managed by the Investment Manager, Advisers and their affiliates, "Other Accounts"). As a result of the foregoing, the Investment Manager and Advisers will be engaged in substantial activities other than on behalf of the Master Fund, the Offshore Fund and the Funds and may have differing economic shares in respect of such activities and may have conflicts of interest in allocating investment opportunities, and their time, among the Master Fund, the Offshore Fund, the Funds and Other Accounts.
However, it is the policy of the Investment Manager that investment decisions for the Master Fund be made based on a consideration of its investment objective and policies, and other needs and requirements affecting each account that they manage and that investment transactions and opportunities be fairly allocated among their clients, including the Master Fund, the Offshore Fund and the Funds.
BORROWING, USE OF LEVERAGE. The Master Fund may leverage its investments with the Advisers by "borrowing." In addition, the strategies implemented by the Advisers typically are leveraged. The use of leverage increases both risk and profit potential. The Investment Manager may cause the Master Fund to use various methods to leverage investments, including (i) borrowing, (ii) swap agreements or other derivative instruments, (iii) employing certain Advisers (many of which trade on margin and do not generally need additional capital in order to increase the level of the positions they acquire for it) to trade notional equity in excess of the equity actually available in their accounts or (iv) a combination of these methods. The Investment Manager expects that under normal business conditions the Master Fund will utilize a combination of the leverage methods described above. The Master Fund and the Funds are subject to the 1940 Act requirement that an investment company satisfy an asset coverage requirement of 300% of its indebtedness, including amounts borrowed, measured at the time the investment company incurs the indebtedness (the (Qj "Asset Coverage Requirement"). This means that at any given time the value of the Master Fund's or Funds' total indebtedness may (jl) not exceed one-third the value of its total assets (including such indebtedness). These limits do not apply to the Adviser Funds and, therefore, the Master Fund's portfolio may be exposed to the risk of highly leveraged investment programs of certain Adviser Funds. The Asset Coverage Requirement will apply to borrowings by Adviser Accounts, as well as to other transactions by Adviser Accounts <4D that can be deemed to result in the creation of a "senior security."

LEGAL, TAX AND REGULATORY. Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur that may materially adversely affect the ^ Funds. For example, the regulatory and tax environment for derivative instruments in which Advisers may participate is evolving, and ^ changes in the regulation or taxation of derivative instruments may materially adversely affect the value of derivative instruments held J^f by the Funds and the ability of the Funds to pursue its trading strategies. Similarly, the regulatory environment for leveraged investors
