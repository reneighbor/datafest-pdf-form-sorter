otherwise might wish to invest and may have to borrow money to repurchase Units. The redemption or withdrawal provisions regarding the Adviser Funds vary from fund to fund. Therefore, the Master Fund may not be able to withdraw its investment in an Adviser Fund promptly after it has made a decision to do so. Some Adviser Funds may impose early redemption fees while others may not. This may adversely affect a Fund's investment return or increase a Fund's expenses and limit the Fund's ability to make offers to repurchase Units from Partners.
Adviser Funds may be permitted to redeem their interests in-kind. Thus, upon the Master Fund's withdrawal of all or a portion of its interest in an Adviser Fund, it may receive securities that are illiquid or difficult to value. See "CALCULATION OF NET ASSET VALUE." In these circumstances, the Investment Manager would seek to dispose of these securities in a manner that is in the best interests of each Fund and does not intend to distribute securities to Partners.
Limitations on the Master Fund's ability to withdraw its assets from Adviser Funds and Adviser Accounts may, as a result, limit each Fund's ability to repurchase Units. For example, many Adviser Funds and Adviser Accounts may impose lock-up periods prior to allowing withdrawals, which can be two years or longer from the date of the Master Fund's investment. After expiration of the lock-up period, withdrawals may be permitted only on a limited basis, such as semi-annually or annually. Because the primary source of funds to repurchase Units will be withdrawals from Adviser Funds and Adviser Accounts, the application of these lock-ups and other withdrawal limitations, such as gates or suspension provisions, will significantly limit each Fund's ability to tender its Units for repurchase.
SEGREGATED ACCOUNT ALLOCATIONS. Subject to applicable law, the Master Fund may on occasion allocate its assets to an Adviser by retaining the Adviser to manage an Adviser Account for the Master Fund, rather than invest in an Adviser Fund. It is possible, given the leverage at which certain of the Advisers will trade, that the Master Fund could lose more in an Adviser Account that is managed by a particular Adviser than the Master Fund has allocated to such Adviser to invest. This risk may be avoided if the Master Fund, instead of retaining an Adviser to manage a separate account comprised of a designated portion of each Fund's assets, creates a separate investment vehicle for which an Adviser will serve as general partner and in which the Master Fund will be the sole limited partner. Use of this structure, however, involves various expenses, and there is no requirement that separate investment vehicles be created for Adviser Accounts. Adviser Accounts will be subject to the investment policies and restrictions of the Master Fund, as well as the provisions of the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder (including, without limitation, the approval of the Adviser in accordance with the 1940 Act).
VALUATION OF ADVISER FUNDS. The valuation of the Master Fund's investments in Adviser Funds is ordinarily determined based upon valuations calculated by UMB Fund Services, Inc. (the "Administrator"), based on information provided by the Advisers or their respective fund administrator. Although the Investment Manager reviews the valuation procedures used by all Advisers, neither the Investment Manager nor the Administrator can confirm or review the accuracy of valuations provided by Advisers or their administrators. An Adviser may face a conflict of interest in valuing such securities since their values will affect the Adviser's compensation.
If an Adviser's valuations are consistently delayed or inaccurate, the Investment Manager generally will consider whether the Adviser Fund continues to be an appropriate investment for the Master Fund. The Master Fund may be unable to sell interests in such an Adviser Fund quickly, and could therefore be obligated to continue to hold such interests for an extended period of time. In such a case, such interests would continue to be valued without the benefit of the Adviser's valuations, and the Investment Manager may determine to discount the value of the interests or value them at zero, if deemed to be the fair value of such holding. Revisions to a Fund's gain and loss calculations will be an ongoing process, and no appreciation or depreciation figure can be considered final until the annual audits of Adviser Funds are completed.
TURNOVER. The Master Fund's activities involve investment in the Adviser Funds, which may invest on the basis of short-term market considerations. The turnover rate within the Adviser Funds may be significant, potentially involving negative tax implications and substantial brokerage commissions and fees. The Master Fund will have no control over this turnover. It is anticipated that the Master Fund's income and gains, if any, will be primarily derived from ordinary income. In addition, the withdrawal of the Master Fund from an Adviser Fund could involve expenses to the Master Fund under the terms of the Master Fund's investment.
INDEMNIFICATION OF ADVISER FUNDS. The Advisers often have broad indemnification rights and limitations on liability. The Master Fund may also agree to indemnify certain of the Adviser Funds and their Advisers from any liability, damage, cost, or expense arising out of, among other things, certain acts or omissions relating to the offer or sale of the shares of the Adviser Funds.
INVESTMENTS IN NONVOTING SECURITIES. In order to avoid becoming subject to certain 1940 Act prohibitions with respect to affiliated transactions, the Master Fund intends to own less than 5% of the voting securities of each Adviser Fund. This limitation on owning voting securities is intended to ensure that an Adviser Fund is not deemed an "affiliated person" of the Master Fund for purposes of the 1940 Act, which may, among other things, potentially impose limits on transactions with the Adviser Funds,
