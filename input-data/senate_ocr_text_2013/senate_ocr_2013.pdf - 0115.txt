As to the requested information, CTS stands for Corporate Technology Solutions. A & J Fire Protection is my solely owned company.
As for showing 0 dollars for any publicly traded assets and unearned income.... That information is CORRECT. We lost everything in the crash of the economy.

The construction industry, one of the hardest-hit business sectors during the recession, continued to hemorrhage jobs in Southern Arizona last year.	,
i ' And economists aren't expecting the bleeding to stop until 2011.	1
Employment statistics showed steep losses as both commercial and residential building stagnated. Tucson had 17,900 construction jobs in 2009, a 21 percent drop from the previous year, according to the University of Arizona Eller College of Management economic outlook for Arizona.
i
The state overall fared worse, with 131,100 construction jobs in 2009 - a nearly 30 percent drop from the previous year.	i

In Arizona, employees in construction, manufacturing, and professional and business faced the largest job losses (as
a percent of employment within an industry) over the recession.
Sincerely,
Adonia Deakin.
