Mr. Andrew P. Castanuela
Dear Mr. Castanuela:
On August 21, 2012 and October 23, 2012 the Select Committee on Ethics requested that you amend your candidate public financial disclosure report in accordance with your legal obligations under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. The amendment to your form was due to be filed by September 20, 2012.
Because you have not responded to our previous correspondence concerning these corrections within the allotted time, we ask that you take the steps necessary to comply with the law in order to avoid any further action from this office. Failure to respond may subject you to action by the Department of Justice.
If you have any questions about this letter or your public financial disclosure requirements, please contact John Lewter with the Committee at (202) 224-2981.
Sincerely,
JCS/jal
