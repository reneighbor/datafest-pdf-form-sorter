Dear Chief Counsel:
Please find attached an amended page 5, Section PART IIIA, for my 2010 Financial Disclosure.
Line Item 1, spouse retirement asset "Providence 403(b)—Fidelity Growth Company K," was inadvertently marked in the wrong valuation category. That has been corrected.
I have signed and dated the amended page.
K.
